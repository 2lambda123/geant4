     =========================================================
              Geant4Py - A Geant4-Python Bridge
     =========================================================

                           gtest01
                           -------

This test shows some basic tests for Geant4 Python interface;

 - An example of how to connect an existing Geant4 users' code to Python
 - Python overriding of UserAction-s
 - Setting magnetic fields in Python
 - Visualization
 - Thread testing


* How to build

Environment variables, such as G4SYSTEM, G4INSTALL, G4LIB, CLHEP_BASE_DIR, 
CLHEP_LIB etc, which are required for building Geant4 applications,
are required.

After setting those environment variables, try

  # make all


* Notes

Under "g4app" directory, there is a Geant4 user application, which can be 
a standalone application. This application should be build with shared 
library to make a dynamic binding with Python. You can find an statement 
"G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED := 1" in GNUmakefile, which set your building application 
in a shared library mode.
