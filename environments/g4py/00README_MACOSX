<<<How to install Geant4Py in Mac OSX>>>
                                 H. Yoshida and K. Murakami
				 16 November 2006 for Geant4-8.2 release

Geant4Py package can be installed in  Linux or Mac OS X systems. Documentation
on   the    installation   and   the   latest   version    is   available   at
www-geant4.kek.jp/projects/Geant4Py.

This text  is a supplementary document  dedicated to Mac OS  X.  The following
installation procedure was tested on a MacBook; Mac OS X 10.4.8 (8L2127), and 
Darwin-8.8.1.
       

0) General remarks

 You have to install ALL packages from the system DVD, including supplementary
 packages and Xcode packages. Then, OpenGL must work.

 a. Compilation of Geant4 libraries; 
      *.dylib must be created and all header files must be assembled. So
         %make global; make includes
 b. Linker; 
      If ld (linker) complains "Undefined symbols", try
         %setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.4
 c. Path of the Dynamic Libraries ;
      If you have used Configure script to make the Geant4 libraries, the paths
      to the dylibs are set automatically. The environment variables can be
      checked in $G4INSTALL/.config/bin/Darwin-g++/env.csh.
 d. X window;
      For visialization with OpenGL, you have to start Xserver and
         %setenv DISPLAY localhost:0.0                                                                               
1) Installation of Python 2.4.3

The  latest  Mac  products  (as   of  October  2006)  include  Python  2.3  by
default. This  is not  bad for  the basic installation  of Geant4Py,  but some
examples  here   require  Python  2.4  which  provides   advanced  OS  related
functionalities.  So, we recommend you to install Python 2.4.3. (Python 2.5 is
already  published  but  we  don't  tested it  with  respect  to  boost_python
wrappers.)

Visit  the Python language  Web site;  http://www.python.org/download/mac/ and
follow   the  instructions.    Universal-MacPython-2.4.3-*.dmg   is  available
there. Or the site http://pythonmac.org/packages/ provides also *.dmg package,
too.

2) Installation of Boost-Python 

 Visit  the  site  http://boost.org/  and download  boost-1_33_1,  the  latest
version. Then,  run the configure script and  then make libboost_python.dylib.
Please make install it to  the default prefix directory, i.e., /usr/local, for
simplcity.

3) Compilation of Geant4Py

If you have installed Python-2.4  and Boost-1_33_1 as above, you can configure
Geant4Py as below;

./configure macosx --with-python-incdir=/usr/local/include/python2.4\
                   --with-python-libdir=/usr/local/lib/python2.4\
                   --with-boost-incdir=/usr/local/include/boost-1_33_1\
                   --with-boost-libdir=/usr/local/lib\
                   --with-boost-python-lib=boost_python-1_33_1

And  then,   %make;  make  install.   The  libraries  will  be   installed  in
$G4INSTALL/environments/g4py/lib whose path must be added to PYTHONPATH.

If you want to enjoy examples/education, wxPython package is necessary.

4) Installation of wxPython

Download  the latest  version  of wxPython  from http://www.wxpython.org/  and
create the library. The next instructions are taken from the above Web page.

%cd $WXDIR
%mkdir bld
%cd bld
%../configure --prefix=/opt/wx/2.7 \
             --with-mac\
             --with-opengl \
             --enable-debug \
             --enable-geometry \
             --enable-graphics_ctx \
             --enable-sound --with-sdl \
             --enable-mediactrl \
             --enable-display \
             --disable-debugreport 

And then make; make install.
You have to setenv/export PYTHONPATH, adding /opt/wx/2.7

5) Run

 g4py/examples/education/lesson1/Lesson1Wx.py and lesson2/Lesson2Wx.py are
 exaples, using wxPython GUI toolkits. Run them,
    %python Lesson1Wx.py
