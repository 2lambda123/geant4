  Geant4Py is a set of python modules for using Geant4.

==========================================================================

System Requirements:
-------------------
Python
  - only 2.x is tested.

Geant4
  - 7.0 or later
  - should be built in "global" and "shared" libraries.
  - All header files should be collected into $(G4INSTALL)/include
    by "make includes"

CLHEP
  - 1.9.1.1 or later
  - should be built in shared library.
  - Building shared objects is supported since version 1.9.

BOOST-Python
  - version 1.32 or later

(Optional)
ROOT


How to Install:
---------------
There is a configuraton script for building the package.

# ./configure --help 

shows help message;

`configure' configures Geant4Py to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage:  ./configure SYSTEM [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

SYSTEM: System type (see Supported Arhitectures)

Options:
  -h, --help                Display this help and exit

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX           Installation prefix  [./]
  --libdir=DIR              Python modules installaion dir [PREFIX/lib]
  --incdir=DIR              Header installaion dir [PREFIX/include]

Fine tuning of the library path:
  --with-g4-incdir=DIR      Geant4 header dir [$G4INCLUDE]
  --with-g4-libdir=DIR      Geant4 library dir [$G4LIB/$G4SYSTEM]
  --with-g4-version=NUM     Geant4 version (700/701/710/711)
                            Not required after ver.8.0

  --with-clhep-incdir=DIR   CLHEP header dir [$CLHEP_INCLUDE_DIR]
  --with-clhep-libdir=DIR   CLHEP library dir [$CLHEP_LIB_DIR]
  --with-clhep-lib=LIB      library name of libCLHEP.so [CLHEP|$CLHEP_LIB]

  --with-python-incdir=DIR  Python header dir [/usr/include/python],
                            (location of pyconfig.h)
  --with-python-libdir=DIR  Python library dir [/usr/lib]

  --with-boost-incdir=DIR   BOOST-C++ header dir [/usr/include],
                            (location of boost/)
  --with-boost-libdir=DIR   BOOST-C++ library dir [/usr/lib]
  --with-boost-python-lib=LIB library name of libboost_python.so [boost_python]

  --with-package-dir=DIR    Geant4 Package dir

Enable/disable options: prefix with either --enable- or --disable-
  openglx      OpenGL support     [auto]
  openglxm     OpenGLXm support   [disable, $G4VIS_USE_OPENGLXM]
  raytracerx   RayTracerX support [disable, $G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACERX]

Supported Architectures:
  linux           for Linux gcc 3.x and 4.x
  linuxx8664gcc   for AMD Opteron and Intel EM64T Linux gcc 3.x and 4.x
  macosx          for MacOS X with gcc (test)


You can specify all parameters adopting your environment.

For example, 
# ./configure linux 
  --with-g4-incdir=/opt/heplib/Geant4/geant4.8.1/include 
  --with-g4-libdir=/opt/heplib/Geant4/geant4.8.1/slib/Linux-g++ 
  --with-clhep-incdir=/opt/heplib/CLHEP/2.0.2.2/include 
  --with-clhep-libdir=/opt/heplib/CLHEP/2.0.2.2/lib 
  --with-clhep-lib=CLHEP-2.0.2.2

The configuration script will create config/config.gmk, which describes 
your envrionment.

After executing the configure script, then 

# make
# make install

That's all!

How to Use:
-----------
Some environment variables are required to use Geant4Py modules:
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 PYTHONPATH         | Python module search directory
                    | Geant4Py library path ($G4PY_INSTALL/lib) 
                    | should be added.
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH    | additional shared library path to be searched
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note that library paths to an user library as well as Geant4, CLHEP and 
Boost are specified via "-rpath" linker option, so their paths do not
have to be added to "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".

You can import Geant4Py modules in Python just like

>>> import Geant4

or

>>> from Geant4 import *


Notes:
-----
1) >> IMPORTANT <<
All users' libraries should be build in shared libaries.

2) Development Environment:
OS:             SuSE Linux 10.1 (x86-64)
g++ :           4.1.0
Python:         2.4.2
CLHEP:          1.9.2.2 / 2.0.2.2
BOOST-Python:   1.33.1
ROOT:           5.10/00

Have A Fun!!
