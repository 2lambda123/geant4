 - present MOMO's XML functions (save and load) are limited.
	-only available GDML tags are implemented. Not implemented are
		- CSG Torus, Hype
		- BREPs Polygon, Polycone
		- no vis attributes
		- no physical volumes

	- when you want to save unimplemented elements, MOMO warns.
		You can continue to save the file, but the output
		may not be well-formed. You can chech it by
		reading the file with the Web browser.

 - Non-compatiblity of Java's serialization.
	You can save or load in the Java serialized format, without
	loosing any element created in MOMO. But The present
	version MOMO doesn't guarantee the persistency between
	different version of Java nor different version of MOMO.

 - GGE and GPE have been integrated in MOMO and are no more improved.
	Please use MOMO instead.
