MOMO known problems
<OL>
<LI> Electro-magnetic physics list displays "rho-zero" which
     has been removed from the stable particle list since Geant4.3.<br>
     ===> <font color=red> Corrected 2002 May 21 </Font>


<LI> A set of the minimum set of Geant4 canonical classes is lacking.
     This will be available soon.
<LI> "Compile" menu button doesn't work, even though the makefile "Momomake.gmk" is correctly created, reflecting your environment variables.
    Please make -f Momomake.gmk in the directory where your G4TARGET main class
    is stored.
