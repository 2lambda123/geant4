Apart from the heprep1 files:

G4HepRepFile.hh
G4HepRepFileSceneHandler.hh
G4HepRepFileViewer.hh
ref/HepRepXMLWriter.hh

and the zlib headers

zlib/*.h

the other sources (heprep2) are copies from the FreeHEP library
(java.freehep.org) and are maintained there.

The files starting with G4 are geant4 compliant, the others may not be.

Changes made here may be overwritten.
