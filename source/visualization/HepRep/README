This G4 Graphics Driver creates a HepRep File suitable for viewing
by the WIRED Event Display client.  It requires no external packages.

The HepRep graphics format is further described at
http://heprep.freehep.org


Two different drivers area available for either HepRep1 or HepRep2.


Driver: HepRepFile
------------------
The version of HepRep produced by this driver is HepRep Version 1.

Each call to /vis/viewer/update
rewrites the file G4HepRep.xml.

View the file using the WIRED Event Display, available from:
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/Computing/Graphics/Wired/

WIRED can read xml files in zipped format as well as unzipped,
so you can save space by applying gzip to the xml file.
This will reduce the file to about five percent of its original size.
