This G4 Graphics Driver creates a HepRep File suitable for viewing
by the WIRED Event Display client.  It requires no external packages.

The HepRep graphics format is further described at
http://heprep.freehep.org


Two different drivers are available for either HepRep1 or HepRep2.


Driver: HepRepFile
------------------
The version of HepRep produced by this driver is HepRep Version 1.

Each call to /vis/viewer/update
rewrites the file G4HepRep.xml.

View the file using the WIRED Event Display, available from:
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/Computing/Graphics/Wired/

WIRED can read xml files in zipped format as well as unzipped,
so you can save space by applying gzip to the xml file.
This will reduce the file to about five percent of its original size.

Driver: HepRepXML
-----------------
The version of HepRep produced by this driver is HepRep Version 2.

It uses ZLIB and ZIPIOS (included in the HepRep driver) to
compress the files if necessary. ZLIB and ZIPIOS are included in the
zlib and zipios++ include directories and further licensed and described there.

HepRep XML files can contain multiple HepRep events/geometries.
If the file contains more than one HepRep it is not strictly XML anymore.
Files can be written in .heprep.zip .heprep.gz or .heprep format. 
The .heprep.zip is the default for file output, the .heprep is the default 
for stdout and stderr.

(Optional) To set the filename, where the extension should be .heprep.zip 
.heprep.gz or .heprep (.zip and .gz will compress), use:

/vis/scene/create filename.heprep.zip


(Optional) To create separate files for each event, use a filename such as 
filename-0001.heprep.zip to start writing files from 0001 to 9999 (or up),
while filename-55.heprep.zip will start writing files from 55 to 99 (or up).

/vis/scene/create filename-0001.heprep.zip


(Optional) To route the HepRep XML output to stdout (or stderr), 
by default uncompressed, use:

/vis/scene/create stdout


To select the driver, where the file if not create by scene is set to 
G4HepRepOutput.heprep.zip, use:

/vis/open HepRepXML


To write 10 events, use:

/run/beamOn 10


(Optional) To accumulate multiple (5) G4 events into one HepRep event, use:
/vis/scene/endOfEventAction accumulate
/run/beamOn 5
/vis/viewer/update


(Optional) To close the file, remove the SceneHandler, use:

/vis/sceneHandler/remove scene-handler-0


View the file using the WIRED Event Display, available from:

http://wired.freehep.org


Limitations:

Only one SceneHandler can exist at any time, connected to a single Viewer. 
Since the HepRep format is a model rather than a view this is not a real
limitation. In WIRED you can create as many views (SceneHandlers) as you like.
