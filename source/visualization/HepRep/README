This G4 Graphics Driver creates a HepRep File suitable for viewing
by the WIRED Event Display client.  It requires no external packages.

The HepRep graphics format is further described at
http://heprep.freehep.org


Two different drivers are available for either HepRep1 or HepRep2.


Driver: HepRepFile
------------------
The version of HepRep produced by this driver is HepRep Version 1.

Each call to /vis/viewer/update
rewrites the file G4HepRep.xml.

View the file using the WIRED Event Display, available from:
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/Computing/Graphics/Wired/

WIRED can read xml files in zipped format as well as unzipped,
so you can save space by applying gzip to the xml file.
This will reduce the file to about five percent of its original size.

Driver: HepRepXML
-----------------
The version of HepRep produced by this driver is HepRep Version 2.

It uses ZLIB and ZIPIOS (included in the HepRep driver) to
compress the files if necessary. ZLIB and ZIPIOS are included in the
zlib and zipios++ include directories and further licensed and described there.

HepRep XML files can contain multiple HepRep events/geometries.
If the file contains more than one HepRep it is not strictly XML anymore.
Files can be written in .heprep.zip or .heprep format. The former is the
default for file output, the latter is the default for stdout and stderr.

(Optional) To set the filename, where the extension should be .heprep.zip or .heprep (zip will compress), use:
/vis/scene/create filename.heprep.zip

(Optional) To route the HepRep XML output to stdout (or stderr), by default uncompressed, use:
/vis/scene/create stdout

To select the driver, where the file if not create by scene is set to G4HepRepOuput.zip, use:
/vis/open HepRepXML

To write an event, use:
/run/beamOn 1

To write the geometry, use:
/vis/viewer/flush

(Optional) To close the file, remove the SceneHandler, use:
/vis/sceneHandler/remove scene-handler-0

View the file using the WIRED Event Display, available from:
http://wired.freehep.org

Limitations:
Only one SceneHandler can exist at any time, connected to a single Viewer.
