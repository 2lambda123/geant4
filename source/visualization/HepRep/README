This G4 Graphics Driver creates a HepRep File suitable for viewing
by the WIRED Event Display client.  It requires no external packages.

The HepRep graphics format is further described at
http://heprep.freehep.org
The version of HepRep produced by this driver is HepRep Version 1.

Each call to /vis/viewer/update
rewrites the file G4HepRep.xml.


Use the WIRED Event Display Client to View the HepRep XML File

To view the XML file, you will need to run a special new version of
the WIRED event display.  This in turn requires Java version 1.3 or higher.

For the most part, you can follow the instructions at the
BaBar WIRED Home Page:

http://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/Computing/Graphics/Wired/index.html#applicationinstall

BUT instead of taking the version of install.class that it points you to,
take the special new version from:

http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/install.class

AND make sure you have Java version 1.3 or higher.
To check, type "java -version"

Once you have WIRED installed, start wired as usual by just typing "wired".

An empty detector will appear.  This is a holdover from the BaBar use
of this WIRED version.  If you are not viewing BaBar events, turn this
detector off by opening the Event Visibility Control (the icon that
looks like a tree) and un-checking "Detector Geometry".

Open the event chooser (the icon that looks like a file folder).
Select Open Event from File or Open Event from URL.
File can be read in from gzip or uncompressed versions.

Some example events can be found at:
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/heprepxml/babar1.xml.gz
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/heprepxml/babar2.xml.gz
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/heprepxml/g4heprep.xml.gz
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/heprepxml/underground_detector.xml.gz

If nothing appears, it may be that you need to rescale the display.
Place the mouse in the graphics window, hit the right mouse button
and then select Orientation Actions -> Fit to Window.
