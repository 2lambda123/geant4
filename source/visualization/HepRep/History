                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

4th February 2002  Joseph Perl  (vis-V04-00-01)
- Check for missing hierarchy layers in HepRepXMLWriter.
  (Not strictly needed since have a culled layer check in SceneHandler,
  but may be useful in other applications of HepRepXMLWriter).

3rd February 2002  Joseph Perl
- Detect transient data by testing for
  !fpCurrentPV || fReadyForTransients
  rather than just fReadyForTransients

1st February 2002  Joseph Perl
- Defer file opening until first real HepRepType is to be written.
- Moved HepRep code from AddThis to AddPrimitive.
- Add additional levels to hierarchy if any appear to have been
  removed by culling.
- Add visibility attribute.

29th January 2002  Joseph Perl
- Relocate file-opening logic to constructor and ShowView
  (had been in SetView).

28th January 2002  Joseph Perl
- Produce hierarchical output rather than flat HepRepType structure.
- Handle trajectories as well as detector geometry.
- Output files now named G4Data<n>.heprep where n increments with each open.

19th November 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-19)
- Added G4HEPREPFILEDEBUG to control debug code.
- Changed <fstream.h> to "g4std/fstream".
- Changed cout to G4cout, endl to G4endl.
- Changed G4HepRep.xml to G4HepRepFile.xml in hepRepXMLWriter->open("..."");

8th November 2001  Joseph Perl
- HepRep Type names now come from Physical Volume names.
- Added many HepRep Attributes for other volume properties.

6th November 2001  John Allison  (HepRep-pure-C++-1st-version)
- Removed HepRep files G4HepRep.hh, G4HepRepSceneHandler.hh,
  G4HepRepViewer.hh, G4HepRep.cc, G4HepRepSceneHandler.cc and
  G4HepRepViewer.cc (recoverable with tag HepRep-Java-version).
- Added HepRepFile from version of 27th September 2001  Joseph Perl.
  First pure C++ version (eliminates need for Java jni or freehep).
  Named as HepRepFile rather than HepRep.
- GNUmakefile: removed CPPFLAGS += -DHEPREP and CPPFLAGS += -DDEBUG.
- README: completely re-written for HepRepFile.

6th November 2001  John Allison  (HepRep-Java-version)
- Tagged before major revision.

26th August 2001  Joseph Perl
- handle PolyHedron.getNoFacets()==0 and improve README.
