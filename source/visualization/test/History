22nd April 2002  John Allison
- Added SharedSolidDetectorConstruction.

27th September 2001  John Allison (vis-test-V03-02-00)
- Removed hits and hit collection code to avoid dependence on STLinterface.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
- Moved drawing of scale from stepping action to event action.

17th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-12)

15th March 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-08)
- Major re-work of replica instantiation in MyDetectorConstruction.cc
  to ensure correspondence with rule that phi=0 bisects the replicated
  sub-volume.  Note: replicas still cause crash on Linux in Ray Tracer.
- Suppressed multiple scattereing lateral displacement in MyPhysicsList.cc
  (can't remember why!).

21st February 2001  John Allison
- Changed test14.g4m to new commands.

1st February 2001  John Allison (vis-V03-00-01)
- Added /vis/set/sides 100 to test19.g4m and changed rayTracer to 400x400.

16th January 2001  John Allison
- Changed screen units to pixels in MySteppingAction.cc.

3rd July 2000  John Allison
- Switched to replicas in MyDetectorConstruction.

22nd May 2000  John Allison
- Invoke G4UItcsh in G4UIterminal in test19.cc (needs interfaces-V01-01-00).
- Evgeni's node positions to avoid shared faces/edges in
  MyDetectorConstruction.cc.
- Changed colour of intercepts in MySteppingAction.cc.
- Demonstrated G4VTreeGraphicsScene in test19.cc.

12th April 2000  John Allison  vis-V01-01-01
- Added more boolean shapes and window to test.

11th January 2000  John Allison
- Added Sphere and test of displaced solids.

16th December 1999  John Allison
- MyDetectorConstruction.cc: added replica volumes.
- test19.cc: added more printing to check destruction of managers.
- test19.g4m: added commands for viewing replicas.

12th August  Guy Barrand
- introduce the X11 resource file test19.xrm
  to control appearance of things. It is used
  as usual with : setenv XENVIRONMENT test19.xrm

10th August  Guy Barrand
- test19.cc : execute win32.g4m on NT.
- correct Initialize method in test_utils/SD files.
- GNUmakefiles : use G4ATLAS variable to say where is ATLAS
                 and test is it is installed.

vis-00-02-02  9th August  John Allison
- Commented out old commands in test19.g4m.

vis-00-07-01  3rd July 1998  John Allison
- Added CPPFLAGS += -I$(G4BASE)/digits+hits/digits/include to GNUmakefile.

vis-00-06-06  11th June 1998  John Allison
- GNUmakefile handles new digits+hits.
- GNUmakefile uses default vis library creation (separate libraries).
- test_utils/GNUmakefile and babar_utils/GNUmakefile use G4VIS_USE.gmk.
- test_utils - various hacking to get it to work with alpha07!

vis-00-06-01 29th April 1998  John Allison

               by default create, through "Wo" gs,
               an XoCamera seen handled by Wo.

vis-test-00-05-01  18th March  John Allison
