- Suppressed multiple scattereing lateral displacement in MyPhysicsList.cc
  (can't remember why!).

- Demonstrated G4VTreeGraphicsScene in test19.cc.

  to control appearance of things. It is used
  as usual with : setenv XENVIRONMENT test19.xrm

10th August  Guy Barrand
- test19.cc : execute win32.g4m on NT.
- correct Initialize method in test_utils/SD files.
