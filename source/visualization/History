                glXMakeCurrent (dpy, win, cx);
                G4OpenGLViewer::SetView ();  
              }

                glXWaitGL ();
                glFlush ();
              }


vis-01-00-04 11th January 1999  John Allison
- Completed change of names from scene to sceneHandler, view to viewer.

- OpenGL - reverted to 100%.

vis-00-04-03  9th December 1998  John Allison
- Made /vis/ commands from /vis~/.  The idea is to maintain backwards
  compatibility while allowing us to "deprecate" the old commands over
  a period of time.  Some of these /vis/ commands respond with "superceded",
  i.e., superceded by new commands, but still available in /vis~/.
- OpenGL viewing volume increased by 20% to prevent corners being clipped.

- 08/12/98 : G.Barrand : OpenInventor : due to 
  huge load problems on various platforms, init only
  the HEPVis things that are needed.

- Merged 6th November changes with vis-00-03-05a
- Bug fix in G4VisManager::IsValidView for batch running.
- Needs greps-00-03-03.

vis-00-03-05a  9th November 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- VRML 2.0 Visualization driver is added to 
  management/include/MyVisManager.cc.

vis-00-03-05  9th November 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- VRML 2.0 Visualization driver is commited:
 (1) Generatin of VRML 2.0 format files to describe Geant4 simulation.
 (2) Interactive displaying of physiccal-volume names and copy numbers
 (3) Interactive displaying of hit positions (displayed strings are
     costomizable.
 (4) Wireframe drawing style of Geant4 visualization is reflected as
     transparency = 0.7.  This value is customizable.
     If transparency is 1.0, drawing of detector geometry is skipped,
     and hits can be picked easily.

6th November 1998  John Allison
- Implemented basic /vis/viewer commands.
- Added `const G4String& name' argument to G4VScene and G4VView constructors.

vis-00-03-04  30th October 1998  John Allison
- Tagged.

29th October 1998  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenGLXView.hh, G4OpenGLXmView.cc, G4OpenGLXmWindowHandlingCallbacks.cc
  in order that things compile and compile without warnings on HP/aCC

14th October 1998  John Allison
- Augmented the new /vis/ commands.  Still not complete but they
  co-work with the old commands.
- Changed char* fName to G4String fName in G4VScene and G4VView.
  Consequent changes in G4OpenGLView.  Also OpenInventor?  Etc.

11th October 1998 Andy Walkden
- added (not a very good) version of hidden lines removal code. This code 
  suffers from depth buffering artefacts. glPolygonOffset is a feature of 
  OpenGL version 1.1, and can help overcome depth buffer problems. The code 
  to utilise glPolygonOffset is committed, but commented out, as it doesn't 
  seem to work with the version of Mesa available on rsplus currently. My 
  ideal strategy is to enable depth testing, draw the model as lines, enable 
  filled polygon offsetting (glPolygonOffset(1.0 /*offset scale factor*/, 
  2/*offset bias*/); glEnable (GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILLED);) then draw the 
  model as filled polygons. The offsetting should just add `2' (in window 
  coordinates, I think) onto the z value of all vertices relating to filled 
  polygons, thus dismissing the conflict between almost identical z values 
  for lines and filled polygon edges.

vis-00-03-03 9th October 1998  John Allison
- G4VisManager inherits G4VStateDependent.  This is used to draw
  end-of-event models.

4th October 1998 Andy Walkden
- Added ability for all G4OpenGLX derived graphics systems to produce
  vectored PostScript hardcopy. Facility for `automated screen dump'
  (i.e. pixmap output) still kept, as some rasterization features
  don't make it into the vectored PostScript output (such as haloing
  effects). Facility currently available via G4OpenGLXm by clicking
  `Miscellany' then `Create .eps file', to get a popup printing
  window.

vis-00-03-02a  26th September 1998  
- DAWNFILE driver is made platform dependent.
  (It is now compilable both at both Unix and NT without necessity
   of C macros like WIN32.)

vis-00-03-02  25th September 1998  
- DAWNFILE driver is ported to VC++

vis-00-03-01  24th September 1998  John Allison

- Created visualization/test/OPACS (do.)

12th August 1998  John Allison
- More new commands - not fully functional yet.

11th August 1998  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventor : remove uneccesary includes.

- Bug fix in G4VisManager: now follows change of world volume after
  /vis~/clear/scene.
- OpenInventor: Correct some upper -> lower case mess (Guy Barrand)
- G4RayView: syntax bug fixes.

4th August 1998 Andy Walkden
I made some changes to OpenGL code...
The changes are (i) to tidy up some redundant hidden line 
removal function calls, (ii) to put some hidden line removal 
code in G4OpenGLScene::AddPrimitive(G4Polyhedron) and 
(iii) to add an option to generate an encapsulated postscript 
file of the current view in OpenGLXm. There is now a button 
in the Miscellany pulldown of the main menubar to bring up 
a shell in which you can specify a filename, colour or black 
and white and request the creation of a .eps file. The 
code is to be found in G4OpenGLXView, and so is not bound 
to the Xm user. Also it needs fixing for some Mesa 
implementations, and the HP CDE environment manages to stuff 
things up when rendering to a pixmap (although CDE makes a 
mess of most other things as well, so this isn't
disastrous).


vis-00-01-08  21th July 1998  John Allison
- Removed automatic refresh from /vis/camera/reset in G4VisCommandsCamera.cc.

vis-00-01-07b  21th July 1998  Satoshi Tanaka

  OpenGL drivers

vis-00-01-07  20th July 1998  John Allison
- Corrected bug in G4VisManager::IsViewValid to trap drawing commands
  before geometry is available.

vis-00-01-06  19th July 1998  John Allison
- Default culling: culling - on, culling of invisible objects - on.
- set/drawing_style does *not* change culling flags.
- Minor bug fixes.

vis-00-01-05  15th July 1998  John Allison
- Cleaned up after name changes.

  visualization/modeling/include;
- added the /vis~/draw/Ghosts [particle name] command
  in the G4VisManMessDraw.cc file;
- added 
  CPPFLAGS += -I$(G4BASE)/geometry/magneticfield/include and

  lines to GNUmakefile to compile G4VisManMessDraw.cc.

geant4beta
============================================================
geant4alpha

vis-00-06-09  26th June 1998  John Allison
- OPACS and Open Inventor - something about widget parents (GB)
- Removed /new_vis/ commands.

vis-00-06-08a  26th June 1998 Satoshi Tanaka
- Updated G4VIS_USE.gmk
- (1) Macro -DG4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE is made properly set
- (2) G4VIS_USE_DAWN_ is renamed to G4VIS_USE_DAWN_OR_DAWNFILE
- (3) G4VIS_USE_VRML_ is renamed to G4VIS_USE_VRML_OR_VRMLFILE

vis-00-06-08  22nd June 1998  John Allison
- Changed G4BASE = ../.. to G4BASE = $(shell (cd ../..; pwd))
- Changed GNUmakefile.G4VIS_BUILD to G4VIS_BUILD.gmk

vis-00-06-07  19th June 1998  John Allison
- Defined G4_SOLVE_VIS_TEMPLATES in G4VIS_USE.gmk.  Needs
  the head version of GNUmakefile.architecture.
- Consequential changes (improvements) to template handling in test19.cc
- Some minor improvements in modeling.

vis-00-06-06  11th June 1998  John Allison
- Fixes to test_utils - see test/History.
- Improvements in modeling - see modeling/History.

vis-00-06-05  11th June 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- In G4VisManMessDraw.cc and G4VisManMessSet.cc , ...
  //    G4double unit = G4UIcommand::valueOf (unitString);
        G4double unit = G4UnitDefinition::GetValueOf (unitString);

vis-00-06-04  10th June 1998  John Allison
- Created G4VIS_USE.gmk to replace GNUmakefile.G4VIS_USE.
- Changed test/GNUmakefile to use G4VIS_USE.gmk.
- Separate libraries are now default in GNUmakefile.
- Committed an interim version of README.
- Moved G4BoundingSphereScene from management to modeling.
- First attempt at defining the "scene" as lists of models.
- Removed some unnecessary checks in G4VisManMess*.

vis-00-06-03  27th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- DAWNFILE driver is added. It is to generate g4.prim file
  under the current directory.  And make DAWN or DAVID invoke 
  using the g4.prim file as an input. For details, see the blackboard 
  document.

21st May 1998 Andy Walkden
- Added hidden line removal code to G4OpenGLView. HLR utilises OpenGL's
  stencil buffer, but still the drawn lines are a little fragmented
  (an effect seen often when depth buffering is used to resolve pixel
  rendering disputes). 
- HLR requires wireframe rendering, filled polygon rendering and then wireframe
  rendering again. Hence, three visits to the kernel help to slow HLR
  rendering right down.

vis-00-06-02  20th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Added G4VisFeaturesOfDAWNFILE.hh, cc
- Revised visualization/GNUmakefile, GNUmakefile.G4VIS_BUILD,
  GNUmakefile.G4VIS_USE
- These are for DAWNFILE driver in preparation, which enables to
  invoke DAVID directly from Geant4.

vis-00-06-01a 20th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- code refinement of FukuiRenderer driver

vis-00-06-01  29th April 1998  John Allison
- Introduced non-pure virtual functions
  Establish/DecommissionSpecials (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  G4VGraphicsScene with implementation of the former in G4VScene.
  Modified G4PhysicalVolumeModel to use it; also protected
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel against non-implementation of
  Establish/DecommissionSpecials.
- Template instantiations in G4RayView made exclusive to GNU_GCC
- Some minor changes under test - see test/History.

27th April 1998 Andy Walkden
- altered OpenGLView's structure a little. Now, G4OpenGLXmView is a
  type of (inherits from) G4OpenGLXView.
- made code for haloing effects common to all OpenGL views.
- changed XUnmapWindow in G4OpenGLXView::~G4OpenGLXView to XDestroyWindow
  (idea of Guy's)

27th April 1998 Guy Barrand
- vis/OPACS : remove Begin/EndModeling in G4GoScene.

vis-00-05-06  23rd April 1998  John Allison
- Changed test19.mac to test19.g4m and consequent change in test19.cc.
- Fixed order of linking vis-a-vis -lG4track and -lG4tracking (GB).
- Fixed inadvertent bug in test_utils/src/MyPhysicsList.cc.
- Bug fix in G4OpenGLXmConvenienceRoutines.cc (GB).

vis-00-05-05  21st April 1998  John Allison
- Added run-time command line argument: test19 [<session-type>] [<verbosity>]
- Removed #if GNU_GCC from template instantiation requests in test19.cc.
- Added fDefaultTextVisAttributes to G4ViewParameters.
- Added G4VScene::GetTextColour (changed G4FukuiRendererScene, G4GoScene and
  G4OpenInventorScene.
- Changed default view parameters: culling on and invisible object culling on.
- Tidied CreateScene/View.
- Continued BaBar development.

15th April 1998  John Allison
- Added test/EucIntfce/, test/Bogus/ and test/babar_utils/ for BaBar test code.
  Also a new main() in BaBarCallListTest.cc.  Also a data file call_list.dat.
  See babar_utils/README.
- Camera commands, except spin and orbit, no longer initiate draw.
- Text is blue for time being (visible on black or white background.)

15th April 1998 : Guy Barrand
- From discussion with John and Simone G4VToolkit 
  has been renamed to G4VInteractorManager.

vis-00-05-04a  11th April 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Code improvements in DAWN driver
- (1) View parameters are sent to DAWN only at drawing times.
- (2) Way of getting marker size are made simpler by using
-     G4VScene::GetMarkerRadius ()  etc.

vis-00-05-04  8th April 1998  John Allison
- Small bug fix - then tag for Easter.

HEAD  6th April 1998  John Allison
- Added error printing to G4OpenGLScene::AddPrimitive (const G4Text& text).
- Added /vis~/draw/text.
- Added units to /vis~/draw/axes.
- Began the job of restructuring vis commands; so there is a new class
  G4VisCommandsCameraMessengers for starters!

HEAD  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Removed automatic drawing after /vis~/set commands.  Now an explicit
  redraw is necessary, but it allows you to change parameters during
  building a view.  For example to superimpose projected hits on a
  section:
    /vis~/clear/view
    /vis~/set/section_plane on 0 0 20 cm 0 0 1
    /vis~/draw/current
    /vis~/set/section_plane off
    /run/beamOn
- Fixed small bug in OpenGL for section drawing.
- Made some small improvements in G4ViewParameters.

vis-00-05-03  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Re-engineered maintenance of current depth, etc.  Needed new method
  G4VGraphicsScene::BeginModeling (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  graphics_reps.  The result is much cleaner model and modeling
  parameters classes.  Also, the current depth, physical volume and
  logical volume are immediately available as protected pointers in
  G4VScene.
- Required G4VScene::Begin/EndModeling to be invoked from subclass.
- Introduced G4NullModel to hold modeling parameters.  This avoids
  having to create a G4VModel for each graphics primitive.

HEAD  3rd April 1998  John Allison
- Added GetMarkerDiameter/Radius to G4VScene.
- Bug fix in G4VScene::GetMarkerSize.
- Removed GetCurrentPhysicalVolume from G4PhysicalVolumeModel - now in
  G4ModelingParameters (but might move again soon!).
- test/GNUmakefile now uses "$(MAKE) separate" for vis libraries.
- test19 recognises argument "1" as a verbose flag value.

HEAD April 2, 98 G.Barrand
- Modifications for Win32/NT.
- G4VIS_BUILD_[OIX, OIWIN32]_DRIVER, G4VIS_USE_[OIX, OIWIN32]

vis-00-05-02  26th March 1998  John Allison
- Added GetMarkerSize to G4VScene.
- Made ~G4VisManager virtual.
- Added current logical volume and current physical volume to working
  space in modeling parameters.  So it is no longer necessary to cast
  to G4PhysicalVolumeModel; all such casts removed.
- Moved nested classes out of G4RayView.

HEAD March 24, 98 G.Cosmo
- Modified G4VisManMessExpert.cc to correctly use random numbers
  by calling directly G4UniformRand().

- First tag with modeling under visualization.
  Here's what you need to do...
    cd prototype
    cvs update -A -d -P modeling
    cd visualization
    cvs update -r vis-00-04-04 -d -P
  Change the following lines in your GNUmakefile...
    CPPFLAGS += -I../../visualization/modeling/include
    LDFLAGS  += -L../../visualization/modeling/$(G4SYSTEM)
    Remove: @cd ../../modeling      &&   $(MAKE)

vis-00-04-03  4th March 1998  John Allison
- Last tag with modeling at same level as visualization.
- Renamed near and far (VC++ keywords) in G4ViewParameters.cc.
- Removed unnecessary #include <strstream.h> or adapted for WIN32.

vis-00-04-02b  22nd February 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Split G4VIS_BUILD_VRML1_DRIVER into G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER 
                                 and  G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER.
- Split G4VIS_USE_VRML1          into G4VIS_USE_VRML           
                                 and  G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE.

vis-00-03-01 26th January 1998  John Allison
- Old environment variables abandoned - see visualization/README.
- G4VisManager is now instantiated *and* deleted in main().
- G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystem.icc replaced by
  MyVisManager::RegisterGraphicsSystems as a way - now optional - of
  a user overriding the default graphics system registration.

Januray 20 , 98 G. Barrand

- Implement object rotation in OPACS driver
  
Januray 19 , 98 G. Barrand

- Correct OpenInventor code so that it is ANSI-C++
  and then compiles with OSF1/cxx, HP-UX/aCC.

7th January 1998  John Allison
- Restructuring to use modeling category.

December 19, 97 G. Cosmo - (alpha03)

- 1st December 1997 - John Allison.
- This is interim code for testing by the visualization
  group and it will be tagged soon.  You must update to the
  head of graphics_reps and visualization simulatanouesly.
  It coworks (I hope - it's difficult to be 100% sure about
  this since I have a few changes for other categories in
  the pipeline - see previous email) with:
    digits+hits              digi-00-02-01
    events+tracks            event-00-02-01
    geometry                 HEAD

    tracking                 tracking-00-02-01
- Addition of:
    visualization/GNUmakefile.transition_to_G4VIS_BUILD
    visualization/GNUmakefile.transition_to_G4VIS_USE
    visualization/GNUmakefile.vis_cppflags_for_G4VIS_USE
  to turn the existing environment variables into the
  to-be-adopted G4VIS_... variables - see visualization/test/README.
- Consequent changes to other visualization GNUmakefiles.
- New way of instantiating graphics systems:
  Set the appropriate environment variables and include and
  compile G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystems.icc in your main():
    ...
    #include G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystems.icc
    ...
    main() {
      ...
- Added G4VisFeaturesOfXXX files which simple return a G4String.
 (Guy, Jeff, would you like to join this scheme?)
- Added commands /vis~/delete/scene and /vis~/delete/view.
- Added /vis~/show/view to test19.odb.
