---------------------------------------

6th November 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-15 needs config-V03-02-09)
- Added /vis/viewer/flush = refresh + update.
- Moved /vis/viewer/lights and viewpoint to /vis/viewer/set.
- Added /vis/viewer/set/upThetaPhi and upVector.
- Added refresh|flush option to /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.
- Moved HepRepFile classes to HepRep/ directory and removed HepRep classes
  therein.

1st October 2001  Joseph Perl
- Added first version of pure C++ HepRep driver, HepRepFile.
  See HepRep/README for details.

10th September 2001  John Allison  (needs greps-V03-02-04)
- (Non-standard tag JA-RAEOE.) 

10th September 2001  John Allison  (not tagged but needs greps-V03-02-04)
- Added BeginOfRun, BeginOfEvent and EndOfRun to G4VisManager, invoked via
  G4VisStateDependent.
- Improved handling of refresh-at-end-of-event.  All scene handlers need to
  implement ClearTransientStore and ensure rebuilding of permanent store if
  necessary.
- Auto-refresh (notifyHandlers) after attaching scene.
- Changed default colour of scale to red and fixed a couple of small bugs in
  the implementation of AddPrimitive(G4Scale).
- Improved verbosity guidance.
- Improved /vis/scene/add/scale guidance (needs greps-V03-02-04).
- Removed /vis/viewer/refresh from compound commands.
- Capitalised 'R' in /vis/viewer/set/autoRefresh.

29th August 2001  John Allison/Joseph Perl  (vis-V03-02-14)
- Needs config-V03-02-06.
- First developers release of HepRep graphics driver.

24th August 2001  Joseph Perl  (vis-V03-02-13-00)
- First inclusion of HepRep graphics driver.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
- Fixed bugs in G4VisManager::GeometryHasChanged.
- Separated out G4Scene::CalculateExtent.
- Improved robustness and timeliness of invocation of some commands.
- Improved READMEs.
- Reduced warnings from OpenGL - see OpenGL/History.
- Cosmetic changes to test.
- Added explicit invocation of base class methods to avoid warnings about
  hiding of base class methods.

17th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-12)
- Coworks with greps-V03-02-02 and intercoms-V03-02-04.
- Added G4VisManager::Draw(const G4Scale&,...  Needs intercoms-V03-02-04.
- Added template graphics system XXX.
- Improved verbosity guidance.

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Coworks with greps-V03-02-02 and intercoms-V03-02-03.
- Moved default value G4Transform3D::Identity of argument from
  G4VSceneHandler::BeginPrimitives to
  G4VGraphicsScene::BeginPrimitives.  Needs intercoms-V03-02-03.
- Fixed bug in G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(const G4Scale&).  Needs
  greps-V03-02-02.
- Added sceneHandler.Begin/EndPrimitives messages to models (long
  standing bug!).
- Removed "dummy" graphics systems in G4VisManager.cc.
- Improved robustness of some commands, particularly
  /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.
- Improved support for multiple viewers (but see OpenGL/History).

11th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-01)
- Implemented /vis/scene/endOfEventAction.

9th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-00)
- Note: non-standard tag to indicate internal use only.
- Added /vis/scene/create at start of compound command /vis/open to avoid
  warnings.
- Removed G4ModelingParameters::hierarchy.  It is no longer used.  The
  textual or graphical representation of the geometry hierarchy is now
  done in G4xxxTree classes in visua;ization/Tree.
- Removed /vis/scene/notifyHandlers from
  G4VVisCommandScene::UpdateVisManagerScene - too much updating going on.
  It was leading to recursive refreshing/updating.
- Implemented auto-refresh at end of event.  (See also OpenGL/History.)
  Introduced G4VSceneHandler::Get/SetMarkForClearingTransientStore for
  postponed (lazy) clearing of transients (e.g., trajectories) from store
  (graphical database) and view.  The mark is set at the end of
  G4VisManager::EndOfEvent and the actual clearing is done in:
    void G4VisManager::ClearTransientStoreIfMarked(){
      // Assumes valid view.
      if (fpSceneHandler->GetMarkForClearingTransientStore()) {
        fpSceneHandler->SetMarkForClearingTransientStore(false);
        fpSceneHandler->ClearTransientStore();
      }
    }
  which is called at the start of each G4VisManager::Draw and the beginning
  of G4VisManager::EndOfEvent.  Thus the picture stays from the end of all
  drawing for the event until the first drawing of the next event.
    
5th August 2001  John Allison
- Small refinements to printing under new verbosity control.

4th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10)
- Re-implemented verbosity control.  Output statements wherever possible
  are controlled by the verbosity in a simple graded message scheme:
    enum Verbosity {
      quiet,         // Nothing is printed.
      startup,       // Startup and endup messages are printed...
      errors,        // ...and errors...
      warnings,      // ...and warnings...
      confirmations, // ...and confirming messages...
      parameters,    // ...and parameters of scenes and views...
      all            // ...and everything available.
    };
  Note that the G4VisManager member object name and type have changed:
    Verbosity             fVerbosity;  // New.
    const G4int           fVerbose;
    // fVerbose is kept for backwards compatibility for some user
    // examples.  (It is used in the derived user vis managers to print
    // available graphics systems.)  It is initialised to 1 in the
    // constructor and cannot be changed.

3rd August 2001  John Allison
- Added README.quick, a quick installation guide.

30th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-09)
- Eliminated view parameters from G4VisManager.  Now, each view maintains its
  own parameters.  Can be copied from one view to another with:
    /vis/viewer/set/all <from-viewer-name>
    Copies view parameters from from-viewer to current viewer.
    Affects current viewer.
- Removed redundant methods from G4VisManager, mostly to do with old-style
  commands.

27th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-08)
- Needs config-V03-02-01.
- Introduced environment variable G4VIS_NONE that, if set, no visualization
  drivers are built and no vis libraries are built, not even
  libG4vis_management.  (libG4modeling is still built.)  The C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are *not* set.
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for visualization drivers
  which do not need external packages or libraries, namely :
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWNFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_GAGTREE_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE
      G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER
      G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE
      G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE
      G4VIS_USE_GAGTREE
  For backwards compatibility, unless G4VIS_NONE is set, the corresponding
  C-pre-processor variables are automatically set.  Also, the C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are set.
- As before, environment variables for other drivers still need positive
  setting of their G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE environment variables.  In this
  category are:
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWN_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPACS_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLXM_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWN
      G4VIS_USE_OPACS
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLWIN32
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLXM
      G4VIS_USE_OIX
      G4VIS_USE_OIWIN32
      G4VIS_USE_VRML
  In this case G4VIS_NONE must *not* be set.
- Fixed unchecked pointer in G4VSceneHandler::ClearStore().

25th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-07)
- Improved access to models (modeling-V03-02-03).
- Made G4VSceneHandler::fpModel non-const G4VModel* for convenience.
- Improved checks and warning messages in /vis/scene/add/scale.

24th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-06)
- Needs greps-V03-02-01 for small interface change to G4Scale.
- Includes modeling-V03-02-02.
- Force rebuild of graphics "stores" (graphical databases) and, if
  auto-refresh is true, refresh of all views
  (/vis/scene/notifyHandlers) after an addition to scene.
- Improvements to /vis/scene/add/scale:
  o Added colour.
  o Assigned a genuine extent.

23rd July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-05 is non existent - sorry!!!)
- Improved /vis/scene/add/scale.
- Improved auto-refreshing.

21st July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-04)
- Added /vis/scene/add/scale.  Needs greps-V03-02-00 and intercoms-V03-02-02.

19th July 2001  Satoshi Tanaka  (vis-V03-02-03)
- Modification of G4DAWNFILEViewer.cc
- PostScript command "showpage" is always added to g4_XX.eps
  so that it is printable. (It can also be inserted into
  LaTeX documents.

18th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-02)
- Ensured rotation and translation of replica is restored (modeling-V03-02-00)

  G4GAGTreeSceneHandler.

15th June 2001  Satoshi Tanaka (vis-V03-01-05)
- The  first committing of GAGTree driver.
- Other files in ./Tree/ are the same as vis-V03-01-04.

5th June 2001  John Allison (vis-V03-01-04)
- Moved re-useable code from G4ASCIITree to G4VTree.
- Made sure all pointers in G4VisManager are initialised on construction.

4th June 2001  John Allison
- G4ASCIITree: Added logical volume name and solid name and type under
  verbosity control.
- G4ASCIITree: Forced culling off so that all volumes are seen, even if
  "invisible".

23rd May 2001  John Allison
- Eliminated Linux pedantic warnings, except FukuiRenderer, VRML and OPACS.

22nd May 2001  John Allison
- Refined ASCIITree.

21st May 2001  John Allison (vis-V03-01-02)
- Minor bug corrections (mostly to fix things that used to work with the
  old /vis~/ commands but ceased to work with the new /vis/commands:
  o If a scene is empty at drawing time, the "world" is added.
  o Window size hint now works for OpenGL.
- Fixed some minor warnings for strict C++ (size_t, etc.).

18th May 2001 John Allison
- Removed unnecessary virtual inheritance of G4VViewer in G4RayTracerViewer.
- Introduced verbosity to ASCIITree.
- Proper deletion of directories in G4VisManagerRegisterMessengers.

15th May 2001 John Allison
- Fixed bug in name of /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane command.

3rd May 2001 John Allison (vis-V03-01-01)
- Changes for greps-V03-01-01 (elimination of RW).
- Improvements in /vis/scene/add/volume.
- Added /vis/drawTree.

10th April 2001  John Allison (vis-V03-01-00)
- Added two new commands:
    /vis/scene/add/text
    /vis/scene/add/axes
- Added first version of ASCIITree to dump geometry hierarchy to
  standard output as ASCII stream.
  This requires two new environment variables:
    G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER
    G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE
  and config-V03-01-00.

2nd April 2001  John Allison

- Fixed some warnings from DEC cxx.

15th March 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-08)
- Changed rotation of phi-replicas in G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc to
  ensure correspondence with rule that phi=0 bisects the replica.
  WARNING: Prior to this fix the graphics did NOT correspond to the
  replica navigation.  If you have been relying on the graphics to
  position daughter volumes in a phi-replica, navigation will have
  been incorrect, possibly without causing a crash.  The above fix
  will change the apparent position as shown by the graphics and you
  will have to correct the positioning of daughters.  Make sure the
  diaghters are all properly enclosed within the replica.  Graphics
  and navigation now correspond,

7th March 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-07)
- Cosmetic corrections for ISO compliance.

23rd February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-06)
- Removed all references to RogueWave.

4th February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-05)
- Reverted to /vis/viewer commands updating vis manager's view parameters.
  Otherwise this can have a big effect on users if old commands are still
  being used.  Let's schedule this change for the next version of Geant4.
- Added the following new commands:
  /vis/enable [true|false]
  /vis/disable
  /vis/verbose [<verbosity-integer>]
  /vis/viewer/set/lineSegmentsPerCircle  [<number-of-sides-per-circle>]
  /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane ...
  Only /vis/scene/add/text and /vis/scene/add/axes to go!!!

4th February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-04)
- /vis/viewer commands no longer update vis manager's view parameters.
- Most /vis~/ copmmands give DEPRECATED warning, except:
  /vis~/draw/axes
  /vis~/draw/text
  /vis~/set/section_plane
  /vis~/set/sides
  /vis~/set/verbose
  which have still to be re-implemented.  All /vis~/ commands are still
  available through /vis/ for the time being.  (Window size hint no longer
   works.)
- Added "auto refresh" to view parameters.
- Added "default" view parameters to viewers.
- Made OpenGL viewers "auto refresh" by default.
- Added:
  /vis/viewer/set/autoRefresh
  /vis/viewer/set/projection
- Added compound command:
  /vis/drawView [<theta-deg>] [<phi-deg>]
                [<pan-right>] [<pan-up>] [<pan-unit>]
                [<zoom-factor>]
                [<dolly>] [<dolly-unit>]

4th February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-03)
- Added several new vis commands:
  /vis/viewer/dolly
  /vis/viewer/dollyTo
  /vis/viewer/lightsThetaPhi
  /vis/viewer/lightsVector
  /vis/viewer/pan
  /vis/viewer/panTo
  /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi
  /vis/viewer/viewpointVector
  /vis/viewer/zoom
  /vis/viewer/zoomTo
  /vis/viewer/set/hiddenMarker
  /vis/viewer/set/lightsMove

3rd February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-02)
- Tidied for CodeWizard.  Small changes to many files in management, modeling
  and OpenGL.

1st February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-01)
- Fixed cause of crash when setting viewpoint before creating scene (Bug #157).
  Solution: SetView no longer called when view parameters are changed.  In
  any case it's called just before drawing, whixh is the right place.
- Fixed /vis/set/sides problem (Satoshi Tanaka) (Bug #204).
  Solution: Update view's view parameters in /vis/set/sides - had somehow
  been overlooked.

25th January 2001  John Allison
- Added protection against empty G4Polyhedron objects.
   FukuiRenderer/src/G4FRSceneFunc.icc
   OPACS/src/G4GoSceneHandler.cc
   OpenGL/src/G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc
   OpenInventor/src/G4OpenInventorSceneHandler.cc
   VRML/src/G4VRML1SceneHandlerFunc.icc
   VRML/src/G4VRML2SceneHandlerFunc.icc

25th January 2001  John Allison  (opengl-V03-00-00)
- Fixed Bug #120.  Implemented running re-calculation of up-vector in
  the case of "object rotation" (lights move with camera) to prevent
  "flipping" of view when camera passes through up-vector.  Note that
  the default is "camera rotation" (lights do not move with camera,
  i.e., remain fixed relative to object) so the default is that this
  "flipping" can happen.  To set "object rotation" (lights move with
  camera) use /vis/lights/move_with_camera true (soon to be
  /vis/viewer/set/lights move-with-camera) or click "Object" radio
  button on Rotation Panel in OpenGLXm mode.
- Changed some objects to references for efficiency.  E.g.:
  const G4Vector3D& vp = pView->fVP.GetViewpointDirection ().unit ();

18th January 2001  John Allison
- Corrected G4PhysicalVolumeModel.  This corrects a bug whereby the
  requested drawing of a physical volume and its decendants starting
  at a depth greater than 2 was incorrectly positioned on the screen.
- /vis/scene/include commands withdrawn - use equivalent commands
  /vis/scene/add.
- OpenGL: cosmetic and minor performance improvements.

16th January 2001  John Allison  (vis-03-00-00)
- All vis commands "available" in all G4 states.
- Other small cosmetic changes to commands.
- OpenGL: square and circle markers correctly rendered.
  Note: subsequent rotations in stored mode also rotate these markers.
- Some small changes to test  - see test/History.

2nd November 2000  Gunter Folger  (vis-V02-00-02)
- Added targets includes and clean_libs to visualization/GNUmakefile.

18th October 2000  John Allison  (vis-V02-00-01)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: protected against volumes without material.
- Removed /vis/viewer/update from compound commands /vis/drawVolume
  and /vis/specify.
- Updated comments in G4VisManagerRegisterMessengers.cc.

19th August 2000  John Allison  (vis-V02-00-00)
- Fixed bug in /vis/lights/direction - now does not refresh view.
- Corrected "scene" where it should read "scene handler" in some
  comments and output statements.

3rd July 2000  John Allison
- Explicitly initialised all data members of G4ViewParameters in constructor.

9th June 2000  John Allison  (vis-V01-01-06)
- Tagged for system testing.

8th June 2000  Guy Barrand
- OPACS/src/G4GoSceneHandler.cc : correct polyhedron 
  wire-frame in order to remove some edges. Now the
  rendering is the same than for OpenGL driver.
   This was requested for long by ALICE, and had been
  requested for ATLAS by Gaston Parrour recently.

7th June 2000  John Allison
- /vis/viewer/update preferred, synonym /vis/viewer/show deprecated.

7th June 2000  Makoto Asai
- Fix the flip view of RayTracer.

2nd June May 2000  John Allison
- Forced /control/verbose 2 for compound commands.

20th May 2000  John Allison
- Bug fix in G4PhysicalVolumeModel for replicas (Guy Barrand).

26 May 2000  Guy Barrand
- management/src/G4VisCommandsScene.
  Protect against a null pointer for aScene in NotifyHandlers::SetNewValue.
- OPACS/src/G4WoViewer.cc :
  Change camera name checking so that a viewer created
  by the GUI (Wo) could be hooked.
- OPACS/src/G4GoSceneHandler.cc :
  Change circle rendering.
- OpenInventor/G4OpenInventorSceneHandler : protect against null pointers.

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (vis-V01-01-05)
- Many bug fixes from in OpenGL (opengl-V01-01-00) - see OpenGL/History.  Main
  features:
  o workaround for bug in Mesa which slowed OpenGLXm (Guy Barrand).
  o multiple OpenGLXm windows no longer cause crash on exit (Guy).
- modeling-V01-01-00: Added G4VTreeGraphicsScene (DTREE).
- G4Scene::IsEmpty if empty of RunDurationModels - VisManager adds world in
  this case.

18th/19th May 2000  John Allison
- Introduced some /vis/viewer/set commands.
- /vis/scene/include/trajectories changed to /vis/scene/add/trajectories.
  Similarly hits.  (Old commands kept but deprecated.)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: bug fix in density culling printing.
- G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc: bug fix in /vis/sceneHandler/create.
- G4VisManagerRegisterMessengers.cc: improved comments.

18th May 2000  John Allison  vis-V01-01-04

- Made G4BoundingSphereScene::PreAddThis non-inline.

13th May 2000  John Allison
- Redefined current target point to be *relative* to standard target point.
  (No longer necessary to initialize current target point in G4VViewer
  constructor.  The fix of 4th May is reversed.)

11th May 2000  Satoshi Tanaka vis-V01-01-03
- In G4DAWNFILEViewer.cc, 
  <       strcpy( fPSViewer, "ghostview" );
  ---
  > //    strcpy( fPSViewer, "ghostview" );
  >       strcpy( fPSViewer, "gv" );


4th May 2000  John Allison
- Tidied comments in G4VisManagerRegisterMessengers.cc.
- Initialize current target point in G4VViewer constructor.
- Re-implemented /vis/viewer/reset to change view parameters of
  viewer directly.

2nd May 2000  John Allison  vis-V01-01-02
- Added /vis/viewer/reset.
- G4VSceneHandler, G4VViewer, G4OpenGLXmMainMenubarCallbacks: corrected
  some name anomolies - "scene" was still being used in places where it
  meant "scene handler".
- G4VViewer: added GetShortName(), corrected SetName(...).

          - Added (long unsigned int) cast in G4OpenGLXmRotationCallbacks.cc.
          - Added SetView and ShowView to G4OpenGLXViewer:

vis-00-04-03  9th December 1998  John Allison
- Made /vis/ commands from /vis~/.  The idea is to maintain backwards
  compatibility while allowing us to "deprecate" the old commands over
  a period of time.  Some of these /vis/ commands respond with "superceded",
  i.e., superceded by new commands, but still available in /vis~/.
- OpenGL viewing volume increased by 20% to prevent corners being clipped.

- 08/12/98 : G.Barrand : OpenInventor : due to

- VRML 2.0 Visualization driver is added to 
  management/include/MyVisManager.cc.

vis-00-03-05  9th November 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- VRML 2.0 Visualization driver is commited:
 (1) Generatin of VRML 2.0 format files to describe Geant4 simulation.
 (2) Interactive displaying of physiccal-volume names and copy numbers
 (3) Interactive displaying of hit positions (displayed strings are
     costomizable.
 (4) Wireframe drawing style of Geant4 visualization is reflected as
     transparency = 0.7.  This value is customizable.
     If transparency is 1.0, drawing of detector geometry is skipped,
     and hits can be picked easily.

6th November 1998  John Allison

  in order that things compile and compile without warnings on HP/aCC

14th October 1998  John Allison
- Augmented the new /vis/ commands.  Still not complete but they
  co-work with the old commands.
- Changed char* fName to G4String fName in G4VScene and G4VView.
  Consequent changes in G4OpenGLView.  Also OpenInventor?  Etc.

11th October 1998 Andy Walkden
- added (not a very good) version of hidden lines removal code. This code 
  suffers from depth buffering artefacts. glPolygonOffset is a feature of 
  OpenGL version 1.1, and can help overcome depth buffer problems. The code 
  to utilise glPolygonOffset is committed, but commented out, as it doesn't 
  seem to work with the version of Mesa available on rsplus currently. My 
  ideal strategy is to enable depth testing, draw the model as lines, enable 
  filled polygon offsetting (glPolygonOffset(1.0 /*offset scale factor*/, 
  2/*offset bias*/); glEnable (GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILLED);) then draw the 
  model as filled polygons. The offsetting should just add `2' (in window 
  coordinates, I think) onto the z value of all vertices relating to filled 
  polygons, thus dismissing the conflict between almost identical z values 
  for lines and filled polygon edges.

vis-00-03-03 9th October 1998  John Allison
- G4VisManager inherits G4VStateDependent.  This is used to draw
  end-of-event models.

4th October 1998 Andy Walkden
- Added ability for all G4OpenGLX derived graphics systems to produce
  vectored PostScript hardcopy. Facility for `automated screen dump'
  (i.e. pixmap output) still kept, as some rasterization features
  don't make it into the vectored PostScript output (such as haloing
  effects). Facility currently available via G4OpenGLXm by clicking
  `Miscellany' then `Create .eps file', to get a popup printing
  window.

vis-00-03-02a  26th September 1998  
- DAWNFILE driver is made platform dependent.

- OpenInventor: Correct some upper -> lower case mess (Guy Barrand)
- G4RayView: syntax bug fixes.

4th August 1998 Andy Walkden
I made some changes to OpenGL code...
The changes are (i) to tidy up some redundant hidden line 
removal function calls, (ii) to put some hidden line removal 
code in G4OpenGLScene::AddPrimitive(G4Polyhedron) and 
(iii) to add an option to generate an encapsulated postscript 
file of the current view in OpenGLXm. There is now a button 
in the Miscellany pulldown of the main menubar to bring up 
a shell in which you can specify a filename, colour or black 
and white and request the creation of a .eps file. The 
code is to be found in G4OpenGLXView, and so is not bound 
to the Xm user. Also it needs fixing for some Mesa 
implementations, and the HP CDE environment manages to stuff 
things up when rendering to a pixmap (although CDE makes a 
mess of most other things as well, so this isn't
disastrous).


vis-00-01-08  21th July 1998  John Allison

vis-00-06-09  26th June 1998  John Allison
- OPACS and Open Inventor - something about widget parents (GB)
- Removed /new_vis/ commands.

vis-00-06-08a  26th June 1998 Satoshi Tanaka
- Updated G4VIS_USE.gmk
- (1) Macro -DG4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE is made properly set
- (2) G4VIS_USE_DAWN_ is renamed to G4VIS_USE_DAWN_OR_DAWNFILE
- (3) G4VIS_USE_VRML_ is renamed to G4VIS_USE_VRML_OR_VRMLFILE

vis-00-06-08  22nd June 1998  John Allison
- Changed G4BASE = ../.. to G4BASE = $(shell (cd ../..; pwd))
- Changed GNUmakefile.G4VIS_BUILD to G4VIS_BUILD.gmk

vis-00-06-07  19th June 1998  John Allison
- Defined G4_SOLVE_VIS_TEMPLATES in G4VIS_USE.gmk.  Needs
  the head version of GNUmakefile.architecture.
- Consequential changes (improvements) to template handling in test19.cc
- Some minor improvements in modeling.

vis-00-06-06  11th June 1998  John Allison
- Fixes to test_utils - see test/History.
- Improvements in modeling - see modeling/History.

vis-00-06-05  11th June 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- In G4VisManMessDraw.cc and G4VisManMessSet.cc , ...
  //    G4double unit = G4UIcommand::valueOf (unitString);
        G4double unit = G4UnitDefinition::GetValueOf (unitString);

vis-00-06-04  10th June 1998  John Allison
- Created G4VIS_USE.gmk to replace GNUmakefile.G4VIS_USE.
- Changed test/GNUmakefile to use G4VIS_USE.gmk.
- Separate libraries are now default in GNUmakefile.
- Committed an interim version of README.
- Moved G4BoundingSphereScene from management to modeling.
- First attempt at defining the "scene" as lists of models.
- Removed some unnecessary checks in G4VisManMess*.

vis-00-06-03  27th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- DAWNFILE driver is added. It is to generate g4.prim file
  under the current directory.  And make DAWN or DAVID invoke 
  using the g4.prim file as an input. For details, see the blackboard 
  document.

21st May 1998 Andy Walkden
- Added hidden line removal code to G4OpenGLView. HLR utilises OpenGL's
  stencil buffer, but still the drawn lines are a little fragmented
  (an effect seen often when depth buffering is used to resolve pixel
  rendering disputes). 
- HLR requires wireframe rendering, filled polygon rendering and then wireframe
  rendering again. Hence, three visits to the kernel help to slow HLR
  rendering right down.

vis-00-06-02  20th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Added G4VisFeaturesOfDAWNFILE.hh, cc
- Revised visualization/GNUmakefile, GNUmakefile.G4VIS_BUILD,
  GNUmakefile.G4VIS_USE
- These are for DAWNFILE driver in preparation, which enables to
  invoke DAVID directly from Geant4.

vis-00-06-01a 20th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- code refinement of FukuiRenderer driver

vis-00-06-01  29th April 1998  John Allison
- Introduced non-pure virtual functions
  Establish/DecommissionSpecials (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  G4VGraphicsScene with implementation of the former in G4VScene.
  Modified G4PhysicalVolumeModel to use it; also protected
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel against non-implementation of
  Establish/DecommissionSpecials.
- Template instantiations in G4RayView made exclusive to GNU_GCC
- Some minor changes under test - see test/History.

27th April 1998 Andy Walkden
- altered OpenGLView's structure a little. Now, G4OpenGLXmView is a
  type of (inherits from) G4OpenGLXView.
- made code for haloing effects common to all OpenGL views.
- changed XUnmapWindow in G4OpenGLXView::~G4OpenGLXView to XDestroyWindow
  (idea of Guy's)

27th April 1998 Guy Barrand
- vis/OPACS : remove Begin/EndModeling in G4GoScene.

vis-00-05-06  23rd April 1998  John Allison

- Fixed order of linking vis-a-vis -lG4track and -lG4tracking (GB).
- Fixed inadvertent bug in test_utils/src/MyPhysicsList.cc.
- Bug fix in G4OpenGLXmConvenienceRoutines.cc (GB).

vis-00-05-05  21st April 1998  John Allison
- Added run-time command line argument: test19 [<session-type>] [<verbosity>]
- Removed #if GNU_GCC from template instantiation requests in test19.cc.
- Added fDefaultTextVisAttributes to G4ViewParameters.
- Added G4VScene::GetTextColour (changed G4FukuiRendererScene, G4GoScene and
  G4OpenInventorScene.

- Tidied CreateScene/View.
- Continued BaBar development.

15th April 1998  John Allison
- Added test/EucIntfce/, test/Bogus/ and test/babar_utils/ for BaBar test code.
  Also a new main() in BaBarCallListTest.cc.  Also a data file call_list.dat.
  See babar_utils/README.
- Camera commands, except spin and orbit, no longer initiate draw.
- Text is blue for time being (visible on black or white background.)

15th April 1998 : Guy Barrand
- From discussion with John and Simone G4VToolkit 
  has been renamed to G4VInteractorManager.

vis-00-05-04a  11th April 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Code improvements in DAWN driver
- (1) View parameters are sent to DAWN only at drawing times.
- (2) Way of getting marker size are made simpler by using
-     G4VScene::GetMarkerRadius ()  etc.

vis-00-05-04  8th April 1998  John Allison
- Small bug fix - then tag for Easter.

HEAD  6th April 1998  John Allison
- Added error printing to G4OpenGLScene::AddPrimitive (const G4Text& text).
- Added /vis~/draw/text.
- Added units to /vis~/draw/axes.
- Began the job of restructuring vis commands; so there is a new class
  G4VisCommandsCameraMessengers for starters!

HEAD  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Removed automatic drawing after /vis~/set commands.  Now an explicit
  redraw is necessary, but it allows you to change parameters during
  building a view.  For example to superimpose projected hits on a
  section:
    /vis~/clear/view
    /vis~/set/section_plane on 0 0 20 cm 0 0 1
    /vis~/draw/current
    /vis~/set/section_plane off
    /run/beamOn
- Fixed small bug in OpenGL for section drawing.
- Made some small improvements in G4ViewParameters.

vis-00-05-03  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Re-engineered maintenance of current depth, etc.  Needed new method
  G4VGraphicsScene::BeginModeling (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  graphics_reps.  The result is much cleaner model and modeling
  parameters classes.  Also, the current depth, physical volume and
  logical volume are immediately available as protected pointers in
  G4VScene.
- Required G4VScene::Begin/EndModeling to be invoked from subclass.
- Introduced G4NullModel to hold modeling parameters.  This avoids
  having to create a G4VModel for each graphics primitive.

HEAD  3rd April 1998  John Allison
- Added GetMarkerDiameter/Radius to G4VScene.
- Bug fix in G4VScene::GetMarkerSize.
- Removed GetCurrentPhysicalVolume from G4PhysicalVolumeModel - now in
  G4ModelingParameters (but might move again soon!).
- test/GNUmakefile now uses "$(MAKE) separate" for vis libraries.
- test19 recognises argument "1" as a verbose flag value.

HEAD April 2, 98 G.Barrand
- Modifications for Win32/NT.
- G4VIS_BUILD_[OIX, OIWIN32]_DRIVER, G4VIS_USE_[OIX, OIWIN32]

vis-00-05-02  26th March 1998  John Allison
- Added GetMarkerSize to G4VScene.
- Made ~G4VisManager virtual.
- Added current logical volume and current physical volume to working
  space in modeling parameters.  So it is no longer necessary to cast
  to G4PhysicalVolumeModel; all such casts removed.
- Moved nested classes out of G4RayView.

HEAD March 24, 98 G.Cosmo
- Modified G4VisManMessExpert.cc to correctly use random numbers
  by calling directly G4UniformRand().

HEAD March 24, 98 G.Barrand
- GNUmakefile : MAKESHLIB changed in G4MAKESHLIB

vis-00-05-01a  24 March 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Geometry tree can be obtained by, e.g., 
  % grep PVName g4.prim > g4.tree

vis-00-05-01  23rd March 1998  John Allison
- Made RegisterGraphicsSystems pure virtual.
- Added verbose level control to printing at initialization.
- Fixed (hopefully) bug in scene deletion.
- Made AddPrimitive (const G4Text/Circle/Square) pure virtual.
  (Had to add dummy void G4VRML1SCENE::AddPrimitive (const G4Text&).)
- Made AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) virtual again.
- Opened some .hh files to G4VIS_USE flags.
- Removed Pre/PostAddThis from some graphics systems (not OPACS, OI).
- First implementation of G4ModelingParameters::hierarchy (DTREE).
- Added Get Global/Current Tag/Description to G4VModel.
- Introduced "working space" in G4ModelingParameters for geometry depth.
- Relocated some template instantiation requests (might give trouble on DEC).

vis-00-04-05a  16th March 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- DAWN driver outputs physical-volume names and copy number.

vis-00-04-05  5th March 1998  John Allison
- Added G4Text/Circle/Square in G4RayScene.hh.
- Added G4Text/Circle/Square in G4BoundingSphereScene.hh.
- Made AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) non-virtual in G4VScene.hh.

HEAD  5th March 1998  Andy Walkden
- Implemented G4Circle/Square.
- Added haloing to OpenGLXm "value added" options.

HEAD  5th March 1998  S.Sadilov
- visualization/GNUmakefile - using $OUT_LIB intoduced in
  GNUmakefile.architecture
- visualization/management/GNUmakefile - compiling G4VisManMessSet.cc
  without optimization on WinNT

vis-00-04-04a  5th March 1998  Satoshi TANAKA
- Environmental variables  to customized DAWN driver is
  renamed from DAWN_... to G4DAWN_...
- Default mode of DAWN driver is  EPS mode, i.e. 
  mode in which EPS files are generated.

vis-00-04-04  4th March 1998  John Allison
- First tag with modeling under visualization.
  Here's what you need to do...
    cd prototype
    cvs update -A -d -P modeling
    cd visualization
    cvs update -r vis-00-04-04 -d -P
  Change the following lines in your GNUmakefile...
    CPPFLAGS += -I../../visualization/modeling/include
    LDFLAGS  += -L../../visualization/modeling/$(G4SYSTEM)
    Remove: @cd ../../modeling      &&   $(MAKE)

vis-00-04-03  4th March 1998  John Allison
- Last tag with modeling at same level as visualization.
- Renamed near and far (VC++ keywords) in G4ViewParameters.cc.
- Removed unnecessary #include <strstream.h> or adapted for WIN32.

vis-00-04-02b  22nd February 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Split G4VIS_BUILD_VRML1_DRIVER into G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER 
                                 and  G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER.
- Split G4VIS_USE_VRML1          into G4VIS_USE_VRML           
                                 and  G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE.

  head of graphics_reps and visualization simulatanouesly.
  It coworks (I hope - it's difficult to be 100% sure about
  this since I have a few changes for other categories in
  the pipeline - see previous email) with:
