to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code

It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every

History file for visualization/modeling
---------------------------------------

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V05-02-01)
- GNUmakefile:
  o added dependency to new module "geometry/navigation".
  o replaced "digits+hits" with "digits_hits".
- Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

22nd September 2003  John Allison  (vis-V05-02-00, greps-V05-02-00)
- Removed a redundant comment.

20th November 2002  Gabriele Cosmo  (modeling-V04-01-00)
- Fixed access to static data (requires "greps-V04-01-04") in
  G4FlavoredParallelWorldModel.cc, to allow porting on Windows DLLs.

11th November 2002  John Allison  (modeling-V04-00-00)
- Added fDrawingMode data member to G4TrajectoriesModel.

24th October 2002  John Allison (vis-V04-01-03)
- Changes for AddThis(const G4VTrajectory&) and (const G4VHit&).

23rd February 2002  John Allison (vis-V04-00-02)
- Removed Begin/EndPrimitives from G4HitsModel and
  G4TrajectoriesModel.  This was causing nested calls to
  Begin/EndPrimitives (and thus to glNewList/EndList in OpenGL stored
  mode), since the trajectories and hits Draw methods themselves have
  Begin/EndPrimitives.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
- Intoduced argument for printing in G4VModel::Validate(G4bool warn).
- Changed default return value in G4VModel::Validate(G4bool) to true.
- Invoke CalculateExtent after successful geometry change in
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel::Validate, and other bug fixes..

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Added sceneHandler.Begin/EndPrimitives messages to models (long
  standing bug!).

9th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-00)
- Removed G4ModelingParameters::hierarchy.  It is no longer used.  The
  textual or graphical representation of the geometry hierarchy is now
  done in G4xxxTree classes in visua;ization/Tree.

25th July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-03)
- Added G4VModel::GetG4PhysicalVolumeModel().
- Added G4VModel* argument to G4BoundingSphereScene constructor.
  Both the above are to facilitate access to a model, if it exists, and
  to invoke methods of G4PhysicalVolumeModel if it is one.
- Added code to curtail G4PhysicalVolumeModel search in G4BoundingSphereScene.

24th July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-02)
- Added G4VModel::SetExtent(const G4VisExtent&).
- Cosmetic improvements to G4BoundingSphereScene.
- Augmented G4ScaleModel::fGlobalTag.

21st July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-01)
- Added G4ScaleModel.
- Fixed bug in G4BoundingSphereScene::::Accrue().
- Also a few cosmetic changes.

18th July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-00)
- Ensured rotation and translation of replica is restored.

3rd February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-02)
- Tidied for CodeWizard.

29th May 2000  John Allison
- Moved code for maintaining depth, physical and logical volume
  pointers from VisitGeometryAndGetVisReps to DescribeAndDescend to
  handle daughters of replicas correctly (Guy Barrand).

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (modeling-V01-01-00)
- Added G4VTreeGraphicsScene (DTREE).
- Commented out pVPV->SetCopyNo(n) on Makoto's advice in
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc.

vis-V01-01-01  12th April 2000  John Allison
- Made G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid virtual.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with composite
  solids - now programmed into CompositeSolid::CreatePolyhedron, where
  CompositeSolid means G4IntersectionSolid, G4SubtractionSolid and
  G4UnionSolid.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with displaced
  solids - now programmed into G4DisplacedSolid::CreatePolyhedron.
- Added G4LogicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid, which explicitly adds
  components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.

vis-V00-01-10  25th November 1999  John Allison
- Adapted header files of modeling for Software Reference Manual.

vis-01-00-05  7th February 1999  John Allison

vis-01-00-05  7th February 1999  John Allison
- Added list facility to G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene.
- Added virtual functions AddThis (const G4Polycone and G4Polyhedra to
  G4BoundingSphereScene and G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene.

vis-00-04-01  25th November 1998  John Allison.
- Added const G4VisAttributes* fpDefaultVisAttributes and access
  functions to G4ModelingParameters.
- Reverted to default assignment operator and copy constructor for
  G4ModelingParameters.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel can now handle invisible daughters.

31st August 1998  John Allison
- Added G4VModel::Validate() and in subclasses.

vis-00-02-05  27th August 1998  John Allison
- Added G4HitsModel and G4TrajectoriesModel.

vis-00-02-04  22nd August 1998  John Allison
- Made G4Transform3D fTransform a member of G4VModel (instead of pointer).
- Reversed order of parameters in G4VModel constructor.
- Much bug fixing.

vis-00-06-06  11th June 1998  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel handles parametrised solids and materials.

vis-00-06-04  10th June 1998  John Allison
- Moved G4BoundingSphereScene from management to modeling.
- Added G4Transform3D data member.

modeling-00-04-01  4th March 1998  John Allison
- Last tag before moving to visualization.
- Removed G4ModelingParameters:: from G4ModelingParameters.hh constructor.

27th January 1998  John Allison
- New (temporay?) category.
- Incorporates modeling code which was in G4VScene.
