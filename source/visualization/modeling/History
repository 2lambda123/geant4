This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

History file for visualization/modeling
---------------------------------------

3rd February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-02)
- Tidied for CodeWizard.

29th May 2000  John Allison
- Moved code for maintaining depth, physical and logical volume
  pointers from VisitGeometryAndGetVisReps to DescribeAndDescend to
  handle daughters of replicas correctly (Guy Barrand).

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (modeling-V01-01-00)
- Added G4VTreeGraphicsScene (DTREE).
- Commented out pVPV->SetCopyNo(n) on Makoto's advice in
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc.

vis-V01-01-01  12th April 2000  John Allison
- Made G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid virtual.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with composite
  solids - now programmed into CompositeSolid::CreatePolyhedron, where
  CompositeSolid means G4IntersectionSolid, G4SubtractionSolid and
  G4UnionSolid.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with displaced
  solids - now programmed into G4DisplacedSolid::CreatePolyhedron.
- Added G4LogicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid, which explicitly adds
  components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.

vis-V00-01-10  25th November 1999  John Allison
- Adapted header files of modeling for Software Reference Manual.

vis-01-00-05  7th February 1999  John Allison

vis-01-00-05  7th February 1999  John Allison
- Added list facility to G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene.
- Added virtual functions AddThis (const G4Polycone and G4Polyhedra to
  G4BoundingSphereScene and G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene.

vis-00-04-01  25th November 1998  John Allison.
- Added const G4VisAttributes* fpDefaultVisAttributes and access
  functions to G4ModelingParameters.
- Reverted to default assignment operator and copy constructor for
  G4ModelingParameters.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel can now handle invisible daughters.

31st August 1998  John Allison
- Added G4VModel::Validate() and in subclasses.

vis-00-02-05  27th August 1998  John Allison
- Added G4HitsModel and G4TrajectoriesModel.

vis-00-02-04  22nd August 1998  John Allison
- Made G4Transform3D fTransform a member of G4VModel (instead of pointer).
- Reversed order of parameters in G4VModel constructor.
- Much bug fixing.

vis-00-06-06  11th June 1998  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel handles parametrised solids and materials.

vis-00-06-04  10th June 1998  John Allison
- Moved G4BoundingSphereScene from management to modeling.
- Added G4Transform3D data member.

modeling-00-04-01  4th March 1998  John Allison
- Last tag before moving to visualization.
- Removed G4ModelingParameters:: from G4ModelingParameters.hh constructor.

27th January 1998  John Allison
- New (temporay?) category.
- Incorporates modeling code which was in G4VScene.
