This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

History file for visualization/OpenGL
-------------------------------------

14th July 2001  John Allison (opengl-V03-02-00)
- Fixed crash in optimised mode: added Initialise() to viewers so
  that windows are opened after viewers are fully constructed.

2nd April 2001  John Allison (opengl-V03-00-01 wrt vis-V03-00-09)
- Tidied G4OpenGLXmViewer callback code.  Removed superfluous header files.

7th March 2001  John Allison
- Changed char* to const char* in many places and that gave problems in
  calls to Xt and Xm.  Hope all's OK.  Differences:
    cvs diff -r vis-V03-00-06 vis-V03-00-07

25th January 2001  John Allison  (opengl-V03-00-00)
- Implemented running re-calculation of up-vector in the case of "object
  rotation" (lights move with camera) to prevent "flipping" of view when
  camera passes through up-vector.  Note that the default is "camera
  rotation" (lights do not move with camera, i.e., remain fixed relative
  to object) so the default is that this "flipping" can happen.  To set
  "object rotation" (lights move with camera) use
  /vis/lights/move_with_camera true (soon to be
  /vis/viewer/set/lights move-with-camera) or click "Object" radio button
  on Rotation Panel in OpenGLXm mode.
- Changed some objects to references for efficiency.  E.g.:
  const G4Vector3D& vp = pView->fVP.GetViewpointDirection ().unit ();

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (opengl-V01-01-00)
- Fixed slow response of 2nd window of OpenGLXm.  Worked around Mesa bug
  by sharing static visuals in G4OpenGLXViewer (Guy Barrand):
    static XVisualInfo* vi_single_buffer;
    static XVisualInfo* vi_double_buffer;
- Removed ChooseVisual from G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc - done in base class
  G4OpenGLXViewer.
- Protected double deletion of window in destructors of G4OpenGLXmViewer
  and G4OpenGLXViewer (Guy Barrand).
- Changed requested bits per colour to r,g,b = 1,1,1 in G4OpenGLViewer.cc.
- Corrected order of CreateMainWindow() and InitializeGLView() in X*Viewer
  constructors.
