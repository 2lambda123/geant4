-------------------------------------

13th September 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V06-02-05)
- G4OpenGLTransform3D.cc: simplified implementation for GetMatrix()
  to allow for porting on CLHEP-1.9.X series.

23rd July 2004  John Allison
- Draws auxiliary edges if required.
- Added auxiliary edge button.

16th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-04)
- Refinements to hidden line, hidden surface removal.

14th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-03)
- Removed superfluous #include "G4VisManager.hh" from G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc.

13th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-02)
- Hidden line *and* hidden surface removal now works.

9th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-01)
- Fixed long-standing problem with hidden line removal.
- Improved messages on failure to get visual.
- Added GLX_STENCIL_SIZE explicit request to visual attributes - most
  systems provided by default anyway, so no effect.

1st July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-00)
- Rationalised G4OpenGLSceneHandler ready for hidden line removal.
- Bug fix in G4OpenGLXmPanningCallbacks.cc for dolly control.

18th June 2004  Gunter Folger (geant4-06-02)
9th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V06-01-03)
7th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V06-01-02)
- GNUmakefile and disclaimer changes - see visualization/History.

9th April 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-01-01 + interfaces-V06-01-00)
- Tagged OpenGL as below.  Joint with interfaces-V06-01-00.

7th April 2004  Guy Barrand
- visualization/OpenGL/* : use the G4OpenGL.hh file.
- Added : visualization/OpenGL/include/G4OpenGL.hh to encapsulate
  the include of gl/gl.h and gl/glu.h that may be platform dependant.
  It permits to rm some #ifdef WIN32 spread in the code. It opens also
  the way to the usage of the Apple OpenGL on a Mac.

17th February 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-00-00)
- Fixed bug #581: wrong order of statements in
  G4OpenGLXViewer::~G4OpenGLXViewer (see bug report).

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V05-02-01)
- GNUmakefile:
  o replaced "digits+hits" with "digits_hits".
- Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

22nd September 2003  John Allison  (vis-V05-02-00, greps-V05-02-00)
- Cosmetic change to regularise names:
  o changed _Feedback3Dcolo to G4OpenGLXViewerFeedback3Dcolor.
  o changed _DepthIndex to G4OpenGLXViewerDepthIndex.

23rd June 2003  Guy Barrand  (opengl-V05-01-02)
- Commit a first implementation of G4OpenGLWin32Viewer.

10th June 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V05-01-01)
- More fixes for warnings in viewers classes.
- Added inclusion of <windows.h> for WIN32 platforms when GL headers
  are included.

05th June 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V05-01-00)
- Fixes for porting compilation on WIN32:
  o G4OpenGLWin32Viewer[.hh.cc]: removed inclusion of <GL/glx.h>.
  o G4OpenGLViewer.cc: replaced local variables near/far with pnear/pfar
    since declared 'obsolete' in WIN32 platforms.

27th November 2002  John Allison  (vis-V04-01-08)
- Improved algorithm of CompareForKernelVisit.

11th November 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-01-02)
- Corrected inclusion of G4OpenGLXViewer #ifdef X_DRIVER.
- Added G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddThis for trajectories and hits - simply
  call default but there as a marker and encourager.
- Added tracking and digits+hits/hits to GNUmakefile.

16th October 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-01-01)
- Fix for WIN32.  Now compiles but viewer not implemented.

24th June 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-01-00)

10th June 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-00-03)
- Cosmetic changes for SUN-CC in G4OpenGLXmConvenienceRoutines.cc.

6th June 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-00-02)
- Cosmetic changes for GNU compiler in G4OpenGLXViewer.cc.

23rd February 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-00-01)
- Changes to encourage compilation on Windows in preparation for
  implementation of G4OpenGLWin32Viewer.  Removed spurious includes of
  glx.h, unistd.h and assert.h.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
- Limited the printing of warnings in
  G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Text& text).

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Improved KernelVisitDecision.
- Fixed a few small bugs in multiple "stored" viewers, but see next item.
- There's an outstanding bug in OpenGL Stored.  If there is more than
  one viewer controlled by a scene handler, after a ClearStore on the
  scene handler, e.g., with /vis/scene/notifyHandlers, the first
  viewer to get refreshed should trigger the display list rebuild, but
  the second need not.  However, when the second viewer's turn comes,
  the display lists are there, and are called, e.g.,
  G4OpenGLStoredXViewer::DrawView calls
  G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists that calls glCallList, but
  nothing appears on the screen.  To overcome this there is some
  temporary code in G4VViewer::NeedKernelVisit which marks *all*
  viewers to force a rebuild.  To see the symptoms, comment out that
  temporary code and issue these commands:
    /vis/verbose c
    /control/verbose 2
    /vis/scene/create
    /vis/scene/add/volume
    /vis/sceneHandler/create OGLSX
    /vis/viewer/create ! ! 1
    /run/beamOn
    /vis/viewer/create ! ! 1
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-0
    /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi 20 20
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-1
    /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi 40 40
    /vis/viewer/set/style surface
    /vis/viewer/refresh
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-0
    /vis/viewer/refresh
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-1
    /vis/viewer/set/style wireframe
    /vis/scene/notifyHandlers
  You may have to do this too:
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-0
    /vis/scene/notifyHandlers
  One of the viewers is empty.  Curious!!

9th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-00)
- Implemented G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::ClearTransientStore()
- Removed G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) (it only
  invoked G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) which is
  picked up by inheritance anyway.
- Removed lots of unnecessary header files from G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc.
- Corrected order of calling base class functions in
  G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::Begin/EndModeling.

24th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-06)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Text&) handles transformation.

14th July 2001  John Allison (opengl-V03-02-00)
- Fixed crash in optimised mode: added Initialise() to viewers so
  that windows are opened after viewers are fully constructed.

2nd April 2001  John Allison (opengl-V03-00-01 wrt vis-V03-00-09)
- Tidied G4OpenGLXmViewer callback code.  Removed superfluous header files.

7th March 2001  John Allison
- Changed char* to const char* in many places and that gave problems in
  calls to Xt and Xm.  Hope all's OK.  Differences:
    cvs diff -r vis-V03-00-06 vis-V03-00-07

25th January 2001  John Allison  (opengl-V03-00-00)
- Implemented running re-calculation of up-vector in the case of "object
  rotation" (lights move with camera) to prevent "flipping" of view when
  camera passes through up-vector.  Note that the default is "camera
  rotation" (lights do not move with camera, i.e., remain fixed relative
  to object) so the default is that this "flipping" can happen.  To set
  "object rotation" (lights move with camera) use
  /vis/lights/move_with_camera true (soon to be
  /vis/viewer/set/lights move-with-camera) or click "Object" radio button
  on Rotation Panel in OpenGLXm mode.
- Changed some objects to references for efficiency.  E.g.:
  const G4Vector3D& vp = pView->fVP.GetViewpointDirection ().unit ();

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (opengl-V01-01-00)
- Fixed slow response of 2nd window of OpenGLXm.  Worked around Mesa bug
  by sharing static visuals in G4OpenGLXViewer (Guy Barrand):
    static XVisualInfo* vi_single_buffer;
    static XVisualInfo* vi_double_buffer;
- Removed ChooseVisual from G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc - done in base class
  G4OpenGLXViewer.
- Protected double deletion of window in destructors of G4OpenGLXmViewer
  and G4OpenGLXViewer (Guy Barrand).
- Changed requested bits per colour to r,g,b = 1,1,1 in G4OpenGLViewer.cc.
- Corrected order of CreateMainWindow() and InitializeGLView() in X*Viewer
  constructors.
