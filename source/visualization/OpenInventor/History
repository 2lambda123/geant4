This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

History file for visualization/OpenInventor

6th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorXtViewer : restore the escape button.
  This button is put in the "app buttons" of the SoXtExaminerViewer.
  (The "app buttons" are put in the left border of decoration).
  It is ok with SGI-2.1.510 and recent SoXt of Coin, 

21th July 2004  Guy Barrand (openinventor-V06-02-00)
- G4OpenInventorXtViewer : add include X11/Shell.h to have
  XtNgeometry that may not come throught the includes of some
  Inventor implementation.

08th April 2004  Guy Barrand (openinventor-V06-01-00)
- Bring in the repository the necessary HEPVis code. In fact few of HEPVis
  is used in this G4 driver. Then HEPVis is no more needed.
  Note that, to avoid clashes of G4/vis within experiments, the HEPVis
  node are protected by some : #define Geant4_<node> <node>.  Then, for
  example, within the G4OpenInventor lib there are Geant4_SoBox, etc...
  (and not SoBox,... that may clash with other HEPVis code in  experiments).
- Have code to run on Windows.
- Split Viewer to have G4OpenInventorXtViewer and G4OpenInventorWinViewer.
- Split G4OpenInventor to have G4OpenInventorXt and G4OpenInventorWin.
  Xt and Win (and not X and Win32 like in vis/OpenGL) to follow 
  the conventions found in the OpenInventor world.

29th October 2003  Cosmo Gabriele (openinventor-V05-02-00)
- Patch in G4OpenInventorSceneHandler in PreAddThis() to cope with changes
  introduced in G4VPhysicalVolume in "geant4-05-02-ref-04", where pointer to
  mother physical-volume was removed.
  Separators map now refers to logical-volumes and is no longer built
  iteratively for each call to the method as it was done in an attempt
  implemented previously.
  NOTE: requires more investigation and eventually a revision of the
        adopted algorithm.
- Cleared usage of 'NULL' in favour of '0'.

4th October 2003  Cosmo Gabriele (vis-V05-02-01)
- Simplified GNUmakefile.

14th January 2003  John Allison  (openinventor-V05-00-00)
- Removed vertex.transform (*fpObjectTransformation) from
  G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polyhedron& polyhedron).
  Symptom was that polyhedron objects were being transformed twice.
  The transformation is stored in 
  G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::PreAddThis
  ...
  G4OpenInventorTransform3D oiTran (objectTransformation);
  SoSFMatrix* oiMat = oiTran.GetOIMatrix();
  SoMatrixTransform* xform = new SoMatrixTransform;
  xform->matrix.setValue(oiMat->getValue());
  currentSeparator->addChild(new SoResetTransform);
  currentSeparator->addChild(xform);
}

27th November 2002  John Allison  (vis-V04-01-08)
- Improved algorithm of CompareForKernelVisit.

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Improved KernelVisitDecision - but see note therein.
