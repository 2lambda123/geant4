/**
 *  Geant4_SoPolyhedron is an Inventor encapsulation of the HepPolyedron
 * class written by E.Chernyaev. In particular Geant4_SoPolyhedron permits
 * to represent boolean operations over solids.
 *  The solids are modeled with HepPolyedron objects. The HepPolyhedron
 * permits to produce a new HepPolyhedron according to the boolean 
 * operation done on them. The resulting HepPolyhedron  is then given
 * to an Geant4_SoPolyhedron for rendering.
 *  Note that a boolean operation could be rendered in wire frame
 * by drawing the contour of the resulting solid (not by drawing
 * the wire frame of a triangulation).
 * (Note: Changed to use G4Polyhedron, which inherits from HepPolyhedron. JA.)
