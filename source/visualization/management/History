9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-01)
- This tag includes all the changes below.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-00)
- This tag is geant4-08-00-ref-00 + change of 5th January only.

5th January 2006  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Reversed change of 22nd November 2005:
  fMarkForClearingTransientStore(true) initially now.  This is so that
  at end of event or run, the view is refreshed and the scene
  (detector geometry, etc.) is drawn or written to file.

14th December 2005  John Allison
- Improved /vis/scene/notifyHandlers so that it forces a rebuild of the
  graphical database, if any.  Particularly relevant for Open Inventor.
- G4Scene.cc, G4VSceneHandler.cc: Improved warning messages.
- G4VisManager.cc: Apply "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" if world has been added
  to an empty scene.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: "/vis/viewer/refresh": if world is added to
  an empty scene, invoke UpdateVisManagerScene, which applies
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", which now forces a rebuild.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fix bug in "/vis/viewer/rebuild".

4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Make G4VisManager::RegisterModelFactories() non-pure for 
  backwards compatibility.
- Add information message to G4VisManager::DispatchToModel when default trajectory
  model is used.

23rd November 2005  Joseph Perl  (visman-V07-01-09)
- Tagged in preparation for Geant4 8.0

23rd November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Enhanced trajectory implementation

22nd November 2005  John Allison
- Added /vis/viewer/rebuild (forces visit of kernel).
- Changed G4Transform3D::Identity to G4Transform3D().
- Tidied initial printing.
- Removed MyVisManager (was deprecated in previous major release).
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: fMarkForClearingTransientStore(false) initially.
- G4VVisCommand.cc: Improved UpdateVisManagerScene.
- Refined guidance of issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on
  "/vis/scene/add/trajectories".
- Improved /vis/sceneHandler/attach.
- G4VisManager.cc: Improved comments.

13th October 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-01-08)
- G4ViewParameters: Added XGeometryString.
- G4VViewer.cc: Pick up XGeometryString.
- /vis/open and /vis/viewer/create: Allow X-Windows-type geometry string
  in window size hints.
- /vis/viewer/set/background: Add opacity parameter.

20th October 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-01-07)
- G4VisManager:
  o Added methods for managing trajectory models.
  o Implemented first version of DispatchToCurrentModel(const G4VTrajectory&,
    G4int i_mode).
  o Created /vis/modeling/trajectories/ for trajectory model messengers.
  o Added XGeometryString for some future viewer enhancements.
- G4VisExecutive: Added RegisterTrajectoryModelMakers.

20th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-06)
- Get standard colours with "/vis/viewer/set/background red", for example.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed G4ThreeVector/G4Vector3D problem with
  CLHEP-1.9.2.1.

13th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-05)
- Background colour - /vis/viewer/set/background.
- Non-uniform scaling - /vis/viewer/scale and scaleTo.
- Migrated to <sstream>.

12th October 2005  John Allison (vis-V07-01-03)
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Trapped zero viewer pointer in /vis/viewer/update
  (bug found by system test of vis-V07-01-02).

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-04)
- Simplified use of ConcreteInstance.  It is now always non-zero for
  an instantiated vis manager; invalid views are reported by the vis
  manager.  The exception is /vis/disable which zeros it; /vis/enable
  or any valid command resets it.

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-03)
- Issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on /vis/scene/add/trajectories.
- Added warning:
  o Attempt to add volume to a scene already containing the world.
- Added error message:
  o Logical volume model must be only volume model in scene.
- G4Scene.cc: Improvement - no functional change.

13th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-02)
- Added WhiteBackground to G4ViewParameters.
- Added /vis/viewer/set/whiteBackground.
- G4VSceneHandler::GetColour and GetTextColour: white and opaque
  objects on a white background are changed to black.
- Added RayTracerX to G4VisExecutive under control of G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACERX.
- Re-instated invocation of SetView and ClearView in /vis/viewer/refresh.

2nd September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-01)
- Introduced optional second pass over run-duration models in
  G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene.

20th July 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-00)
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Protected new viewer pointer.

7th June 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-00-02)
- /vis/scene/notifyHandlers: Fixed case of scene handler with no viewer.

31st May 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-00-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed /vis/scene/add/text to accept text
  with spaces.
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Printed WARNING: Viewpoint direction is very
  close to the up vector direction.
