22 January 2010  Gabriele Cosmo (gMocren-V09-03-00)
Fix in G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc to allow for porting on C++0x Standard:
made explicit with static_cast conversions from double to float. Also use
G4 types in consistent way.

3 December 2009  Akinori Kimura
Line 363 of G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc was deleted.
It was a debug code with G4cout.
Another file I/O bug was fixed. The following files were committed.
G4GMocrenFileViewer.cc
G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc
G4GMocrenIO.{cc,hh}

5 November 2009  Gabriele Cosmo (gMocren-V09-02-03)
Fix in G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc for resolving compilation error on
Windows

5 November 2009  Akinori Kimura
GMocrenFileSceneHandler::AddCompound(G4THisMap<>) was modified
to deal with /vis/scene/add/psHits <scorer_name>.
GMocrenIO.cc was modified to remove an unnecessary output by std::cout.

2 November 2009  Akinori Kimura (gMocren-V09-02-02)
I mistook to make a tag, gMocren-V09-02-01.
So I made a tag again.


2 November 2009  Akinori Kimura (gMocren-V09-02-01)
Deleted the following two AddEndOfEventModel(*) in
G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler::GFBeginModeling().
These models are entrusted to user commands /vis/scene/add/psHits or hits

   scene->AddEndOfEventModel(new G4PSHitsModel()); 
   scene->AddEndOfEventModel(new G4HitsModel());


1 November 2009  Akinori Kimura
A few warning as following were fixed.
src/G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler.cc:1812: warning: dereferencing pointer '<anonymous>' does break strict-aliasing rules


22 October 2009  Akinori Kimura (gMocren-V09-02-00)
G4PSHitsModel.{hh,cc} were moved to the modeling directory.
Made a tag of the gMocren file driver.

18 October 2009  Akinori Kimura
Fixed bugs which are to create an extra file and to be not able to
deal with multiple runs.

12 October 2009  Akinori Kimura
Large modification to support G4PhantomParameterisation,
G4VNestedParameterisation, primitive scorer and interactive primitive
scorer

1 April 2009  Akinori Kimura
The prototype gMocren-file driver is added.
Tagged vis-V09-02-06.
