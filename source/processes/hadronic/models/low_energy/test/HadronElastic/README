Description:
-----------

This directory contains a process-level test of elastic hadron scattering using 
the LEP (Gheisha-style) elastic scattering model.

Protons are scattered from several materials and the outgoing protons are
collected.

The output consists of the scattered proton energy and momentum averaged over 
the number of events.  An option exists to histogram these quantities using 
ROOT.


Running the test:
-----------------

Copy this directory to a test area and set the Geant4 environment and 
ROOT directories:

  source ../g4setup.env

Build the executable:

  gmake clean
  gmake

Run it:

  ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/hadronelastic p Nevt

  where p is the proton momentum in GeV/c and Nevt is the number of 
  events to run.
