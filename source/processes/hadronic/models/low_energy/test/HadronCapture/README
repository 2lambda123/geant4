Description:
-----------

This directory contains a process-level test of neutron capture using the
LEP (Gheisha-style) hadron capture model.  

Neutrons are captured in several materials and the outgoing gammas are
collected.

The output consists of the gamma energy and momentum averaged over the 
number of events.  An option exists to histogram these quantities using 
ROOT.


Running the test:
-----------------

Copy this directory to a test area and set the Geant4 environment and 
ROOT directories:

  source ../g4setup.env

Build the executable:

  gmake clean
  gmake

Run it:

  ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/hadroncapture p Nevt

  where p is the neutron momentum in GeV/c and Nevt is the number of 
  events to run.
