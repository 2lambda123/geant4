Description:
-----------

This directory contains a process-level test of neutron-induced fission using the
LEP (Gheisha-style) hadron fission model.  

Neutrons induce fission in several materials and the outgoing gammas and neutrons 
are collected.

The output consists of the energy and momenta of the neutrons and gammas averaged 
over the number of events.  An option exists to histogram these quantities using 
ROOT.


Running the test:
-----------------

Copy this directory to a test area and set the Geant4 environment and 
ROOT directories:

  source ../g4setup.env

Build the executable:

  gmake clean
  gmake

Run it:

  ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/hadronfission p Nevt

  where p is the neutron momentum in GeV/c and Nevt is the number of 
  events to run.
