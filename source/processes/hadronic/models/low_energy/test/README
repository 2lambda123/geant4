To build tests:

1) set up some environment variables

       source g4setup.env

2) to select which test to build

       setenv TESTTARGET name
 
   where name is the filename of the test
   (without the .cc extension)

3) gmake

   This will put an executable in the bin
   subdirectory within this test directory

4) Run the executable:

        bin/$G4SYSTEM/name
