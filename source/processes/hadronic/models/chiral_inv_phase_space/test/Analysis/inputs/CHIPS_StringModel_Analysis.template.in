400 energy [GeV]
0.7 e/fm: good to tune pion and proton yields
156 #final states considered
0.9 epsilon1 - high gets protons down.
0.8 epsilon2 - high gets protons down.
1.  omega = clustering probability - good for deuterons and tritons
    also for proton yield.

0.3 strangeness contribution (half of the sea)
0.3 eta/eta'
1. vacuum to in medium ratio
80. nuc.rad: together with e/fm good to tune pion and proton yields
