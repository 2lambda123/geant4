           History file for the Liege cascade INCL Model
           ---------------------------------------------

This file should be used to summarize modifications introduced in the 
code and to keep track of all tags.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   * Please list in reverse chronological order (last date on top)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

31 October 2007 - Gabriele Cosmo (hadr-incl-V09-00-05)
--------------------------------
- Again commented out calls to isnan() and isinf() in G4Abla.cc for allow
  porting to platforms other than Linux.

24 October 2007 - Pekka Kaitaniemi (hadr-incl-V09-00-04)
----------------------------------
- Modified INCL to filter out unphysical events containing particles
  that have more energy than the energy of the projectile. This should
  fix problem we had with outcoming neutrons (and protons) that have
  more energy than the projectile particle.
- Added G4InclAblaDataFile class that reads data used by INCL/ABLA
  from datafiles located in $G4ABLADATA. If this environment variable
  is not correctly set INCL/ABLA returns G4Exception.
- Problematic hardcoded data has been removed.

16 October 2007 - Pekka Kaitaniemi
------------------------------------------------------
- Silenced the rather verbose output. Now nothing should be printed on
  terminal by default.
- Fixed INCL internal random number generator bug that sometimes
  (rarely) produced random numbers that were greater than 1.0.
- Random number seeds are now taken from CLHEP::HepRandom.
- Cleaned up some commented code.
- Found new NaN bugs in ABLA.

13 October 2007 - Pekka Kaitaniemi
------------------------------------------------------
- Interface cleanup. G4InclCascadeInterface and
  G4InclLightIonInterface  should be fully operational.
- INCL was reverted back to using simple random number generator for
  test result compatibility (to produce exactly same results as the
  FORTRAN version does).
- Fixes for ABLA evaporation/fission:
  o Fission barrier problem fixed. Now fission code is called during
    the run.
  o Several NaN bugs fixed.
  o Random seed initialization bug fixed.
  o Stand-alone INCL/ABLA program (test/standaloneinclabla) mostly
    works (produces results that are sometimes in good agreement with
    FORTRAN version and sometimes in not so good agreement). With
    heavy targets and lots of energy fission is overestimated.
  o INCL+ABLA interface not yet fully operational. G4 simulation run
    crashes. 

11 October 2007 - Gabriele Cosmo (hadr-incl-V09-00-01)
------------------------------------------------------
- Fixes for porting:
  o Commented out usage of isnan() and isinf() in assertions.
  o Replaced usage of M_PI with CLHEP::pi.
  o Use std namespace for standard mathematical functions.
  o Casted to double arguments used in std::pow() function.
  o Commented out initialisation of data in G4InclAblaHardcodedData.cc
    for Windows; temporary solution to allow for compilation, pending
    solution of loading of data from file !

23 May 2007 - Aatos Heikkinen (hadr-incl-V09-00-00)
---------------------------------------------------
- First version of the Liege cascade INCL Model.
