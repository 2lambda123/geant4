 ========================

 In this directory you can find some useful staff for studying
 calorimeter observables (in particular, visible energy and
 energy resolution) as a function of the beam energy, scanning
 the interval 1 - 30 GeV.

 The compressed tar-balls:
   dirEnergyScan_e.tgz
   dirEnergyScan_pi-.tgz
   dirEnergyScan_pi+.tgz
   dirEnergyScan_p.tgz
 contain the directory structure for the Geant4 macro files
 corresponding to the interval 1 - 30 GeV of beam energy, 
 for, respectively, electrons, pion-, pion+, and proton, 
 for 3 simplified combined calorimeters: 
   - combined CMS : PbWO4 (EM) + Cu-Sci (HAD) 
   - combined ATLAS Barrel : Pb-LAr (EM) + Fe-Sci (HAD)
   - combined ATLAS EndCap : Pb-LAr (EM) + Cu-LAr (HAD)
 For each case, 5000 events are generated, without magnetic field.

 The shell script  scanEnergy.sh  allows to run 1 Physics List
 for one beam particle type (e-, or pi-, or pi+, or p), with
 the 3 simplified combined calorimeters.
