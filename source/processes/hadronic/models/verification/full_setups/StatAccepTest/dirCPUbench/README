 You can find in this directory what you need in order to do some
 CPU benchmark tests of Geant4 on simplified hadronic calorimeters.

 The following Geant4 versions can be tested:   -  5.2.p02
                                                -  6.2.p02
                                                -  7.1.p01a
	                                        -  8.0.p01
	                                        -  8.1.p02
                                                -  8.2.p01
                                                -  8.2.ref02

 To run one of these versions, you need only to run the corresponding
 shell scripts:
  
   o  For Geant4 5.2.p02,  Physics List QGSP_GN :   $  ./exec.sh-5.2.p02

   o  For Geant4 6.2.p02,  Physics List QGSP_GN :   $  ./exec.sh-6.2.p02
 
   o  For Geant4 7.1.p01a, Physics List QGSP_GN :   $  ./exec.sh-7.1.p01a

   o  For Geant4 8.0.p01,  Physics List QGSP :      $  ./exec.sh-8.0.p01-qgsp
      For Geant4 8.0.p01,  Physics List QGSP_EMV :  $  ./exec.sh-8.0.p01-qgsp_emv

   o  For Geant4 8.1.p02,  Physics List QGSP :      $  ./exec.sh-8.1.p02-qgsp
      For Geant4 8.1.p02,  Physics List QGSP_EMV :  $  ./exec.sh-8.1.p02-qgsp_emv

   o  For Geant4 8.2.p01,  Physics List QGSP :      $  ./exec.sh-8.2.p01-qgsp
      For Geant4 8.2.p01,  Physics List QGSP_EMV :  $  ./exec.sh-8.2.p01-qgsp_emv

   o  For Geant4 8.2.ref02,  Physics List QGSP :      $  ./exec.sh-8.2.ref02-qgsp
      For Geant4 8.2.ref02,  Physics List QGSP_EMV :  $  ./exec.sh-8.2.ref02-qgsp_emv

 The output of each of these runs is made of a pair of files:

   -  bench1.log-xxx : run of 500 events of 50 GeV pi- on a simplified 
                       CMS HCAL (Cu-Sci) calorimeters, without magnetic field.

   -  bench1b.log-xxx : similar run as for bench1.log-xxx, but with a 4 T
                        magnetic field.

 where "xxx" is the version of Geant4 (and, in the case of 8.* , also
 the Physics List). 

 You can find the CPU time, in second, by searching the string "User="
 in these bench* files.
