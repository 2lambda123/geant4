 ========================

 In this directory you find what you need for assess the statistical
 power of the Acceptance Suite:

 o  power.cpp : is the main program. Please look at the comments at 
                the beginning of this file for details.

 o  setup.sh : you need to source this script to build and run the
               power program.

 o  GNUmakefile : necessary to build the power program.
                  You need to type simply "gmake" after you have 
	          sourced the script setup.sh.

 The program  power.cpp  compute the statistical power for the 
 visible energy distribution for a 9 GeV pi+ on a Pb-Sci calorimeter, 
 obtained with Geant4 8.0, Physics List QGSP_GN, with default 0.7 mm 
 production cut, running 20,000 simulated events. 
 However, it should be straightforward to modify the program in the
 case one is insterested to evaluate the statistical power for a
 difference observables, and/or for a different use case.

 The following extra files help to visualize the visible energy
 distributions:

 o  save.hbook : it contains two HBOOK histograms:
                 100 : visible energy distribution in the case of
                       default hadronic elastic.
                 200 : visible energy distribution in the case of
                       hadronic elastic G4LElasticB.cc .
                 The distribution "VisibleEnergy" in power.cpp
	         corresponds to a parametrization of histogram 100.
                 The distribution "VisibleEnergy_shifted" in power.cpp
	         corresponds to a parametrization of histogram 200. 

 o  myfun.f : Fortran function used by some .kumac (see below) to
              plot the parametrization (splinline) used to describe
	      the visible energy distributions.
              Please read the information at the beginning of this
	      file for more information.

 o  plot.kumac :  Kumac useful to compare the histograms of the
                  visible energy with their respective parametrizations.

 o  smooth.kumac :  Kumac useful to visualize some of the distributions
	            that are used by power.cpp to generate samples.

 o  check.kumac : Kumac useful to check (debug) the distributions 
	          generated by power.cpp .

 Finally, there are also two useful scripts for running a sequence of
 power jobs, each with a particular combination of parameters :

 o  replaceParameters.py : a Python script that replaces the parameters
                           in power.cpp , avoiding to edit the file.

 o  jobs.sh : a Bash-shell script that buils and executes a sequence
              of power applications, using replaceParameters.py .
