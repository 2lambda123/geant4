 ========================

 In this directory you can find some useful staff for studying
 calorimeter observables (in particular, visible energy and
 energy resolution) as a function of the beam energy, scanning
 the interval 1 - 30 GeV.

 The compressed tar-balls:
   dirEnergyScan_e.tgz
   dirEnergyScan_pi-.tgz
   dirEnergyScan_pi+.tgz
   dirEnergyScan_p.tgz
 contain the directory structure for the Geant4 macro files
 corresponding to the interval 1 - 30 GeV of beam energy, 
 for, respectively, electrons, pion-, pion+, and proton, 
 for 4 simplified  calorimeters: CMS HCAL (Cu-Sci), 
 ATLAS HEC (Cu-LAr), PbWO4, and ATLAS TileCal (Fe-LAr). 
 For each case, 5000 events are generated, without magnetic field.

 The shell script  scanEnergy.sh  allows to run 1 Physics List
 for one beam particle type (e-, or pi-, or pi+, or p).

 The Python script  energyScan  (which in turn uses the
 Python script  addInfoInTable.py , which in turn uses the
 Python script  printInfoLogfile.py ) is useful to collect
 all the information from the generated log files.
 
 Finally, the following Kumac files are useful to produce
 some plots:
   o  plot1_*.kumac : for the visible energy and energy resolution
	              in the case of e- beam;
   o  plot3_*.kumac : for the visible energy and energy resolution
	              in the case of pi-, pi+, p beams, comparing
	              3 Physics Lists;
   o  plot8_*.kumac : for the visible energy and energy resolution
	              in the case of pi-, pi+, p beams, comparing
	              8 Physics Lists.
