  simply with two executables, with the same root
  name, but different final part: -`uname -i` .

  longitudinal and transverse shower profile for the
  following particles:  o  electron (e- and e+);
                        o  muons (mu- and mu+);

13-Apr-2006 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-11)

  counting of the exiting energies.
  This tag has been used for the April 2006 mini-production.


09-Apr-2006 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-10)
- Transition from a cubic box to a cylinder, with radius
  which can be set by the user independently from
  the length of the calorimeter.


09-Apr-2006 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-09)
- Fixed the problem of the counting of neutrons due
  to the suspended feature of _HP Physics Lists.
  Added the monitoring of: fraction of visible energies
  in four quarters of the calorimeter; fraction of 
  visible energies in three thirds of rings; 
  track and step lengths; kinetic energy of exiting
  particles.


08-Feb-2006 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-08)
- Added  anti_proton  and  anti_neutron  as possible 
  primary beam particles. They do not need to be used
  for all the beam energy values: it is enough the
  range 1-10 GeV.


01-Feb-2006 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-07)
- Added the monitoring of the average number of steps
  and tracks per event, subdivided for different types
  of particles.
  Added also the subdirectory  dirUseCases/  
  that collects a set of Geant4 macro files to 
  configure the calorimeter as closely as possible to
  the LHC electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.


20-Jan-2006 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-06)
- Added the subdirectory  dirPower/  to study
  the statistical power of the Acceptance Suite.


18-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-05)
- Added the possibility to have a different number
  of readout layers with respect to the number of
  active layers. Now by default, there are 100
  active layers (i.e. of 0.1 lambda thickness), and
  20 readout layers (corresponding to 0.5 lambda).
  Notice that this spoils the possibility to compare
  with older ntuples.


17-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-04)
- Added the possibility to steer the magnetic field
  from the mainScript.py as a parameter. 
  If this is null, then it works exactly as before 
  (i.e. same filenames and their content).


17-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-03)
- Replaced everywhere "python2.2" with "python".


17-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-02)
- Added a check of the total energy conservation.
  Fixed also the small deviation in the beam energy
  w.r.t. to the nominal value.


17-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-01)
- Changed the direction of the beam from the X-axis 
  to the Z-axis. 
  Fixed also some obsolete visualization code.


17-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V08-00-00)
- Migration to the new Physics Lists, and to 
  CLHEP namespace.


14-Dec-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-07)
- Last tag, as used for the December 2005 G4 release 
  validation production, with everything pre-installed
  in the $VO_GEANT4_SW_DIR/dirInstallations.


28-Nov-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-06)
- Added in dirObservables two scripts, unpack.py and
  pvalues.py, and a kumac, pvalues.kumac . They are
  useful to, respectively, unpack the tar-balls we 
  get from the Grid jobs, and to monitor the overall
  p-values (per each Physics List, and per each
  statistical tests).


24-Nov-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-05)
- Fixed an ordering problem in the main due to the new
  dynamic particles. Added also statistical errors
  for energy resolution, sampling fraction, and ratio e/pi.


22-Nov-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-04)
- Added Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-Darling
  statistical tests. 
  Extended to use of more Physics Lists (LHEP_GN, 
  LHEP_HP, LHEP_BERT_HP, LHEP_BIC_HP, QGSP_GN, QGSP_HP).


25-Oct-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-03)
- Geant4 is now a Virtual Organization, so I have
  replaced  VO_DTEAM_SW_DIR  to  VO_GEANT4_SW_DIR .
  Also better usage of  pow  in the Tracking action.


20-Oct-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-02)
- Introduced the possibility to have magnetic field
  (only along the y-axis, i.e. transverse to the
   beam direction) in the Geant4 macros. Also some
  clean up of the information which are printed out.


13-Oct-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-01)
- Changes to ensure that the transportation in field
  is not used if the magnetic field is zero (which
  is the default value). Removed also all the 
  compilation warnings.


29-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-09)
- Change in observables.py in order to plot all
  beam energies even if not found in log files.
  The kumacs now plot as a function of the
  logarithm of the beam energy.


13-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-08)
- Change of the ordering of  pvalue.cpp  to avoid
  a bug in PI when reading ntuples from two files.


10-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-07)
- Preparing the version to be use for the June 
  release testing. Only few minor changes.


6-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-06)
- Preparing the version to be use for the June 
  release testing. Only a minor change in plot.py
  to pick  paw  from the installation.


29-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-05)
- The kumacs in dirObservables have been modified
  (and a minor modification in the python script
   as well) in order to use vectors directly for
  plotting rather than histograms as before (which
  requires unnatural binning along the x-axis).


29-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-04)
- Added a new sudirectory, dirObservables, which
  contains a python script and some kumacs useful
  to produce plots of various observables.


8-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-03)
- Added information useful to extract the response,
  energy resolution, and e/pi.


7-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-02)
- Included summary histograms for the longitudinal 
  and transverse shower profiles.


24-Mar-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-01)
- Update for Geant4 7.0 .


6-Dec-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-06)
- Setup for running on the Grid.


16-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-05)
- Introduce a beam energy threshold (currently at
  10 GeV) below which no biasing are applied, and
  even the default tracking cut (700 mu) is used.
  Also added PbSci as another calorimeter type to be 
  tested (LHCb ECAL is a PbSci calorimeter).


10-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-04)
- Added biasing for the neutrons, and also two different
  level of biasing for gammas, electrons, and positrons.
  The binning of the later shape has been changed: now
  they are increasing as the radius grows, in such a way
  to keep enough statistics in spite of the rapid decrease
  of the shower with the radius. The default is 10 variable 
  bins, with the first one of size equal to 0.1 lambda.


9-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-03)
- Added biasing in electromagnetic physics (i.e. for
  gammas, electrons, and positrons). Also a cut on
  low energy neutrons has been added. Changed also
  the default production range cut, to 1 cm, and the
  number of layers is now 20 (each with half lambda
  of absorber), and radially 10, with 1/4 lambda size.


8-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-02)
- Migration to PI_1_2_4 (so the temporary bug fix in 
  PI_1_2_3 has been removed).
  More automatization has been introduced: now it 
  builds the executable, and it is possible to run
  separately the simulation and the statistical tests.


3-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-01)
- Fully automatized.
