10-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-04)
- Added biasing for the neutrons, and also two different
  level of biasing for gammas, electrons, and positrons.
  The binning of the later shape has been changed: now
  they are increasing as the radius grows, in such a way
  to keep enough statistics in spite of the rapid decrease
  of the shower with the radius. The default is 10 variable 
  bins, with the first one of size equal to 0.1 lambda.


9-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-03)
- Added biasing in electromagnetic physics (i.e. for
  gammas, electrons, and positrons). Also a cut on
  low energy neutrons has been added. Changed also
  the default production range cut, to 1 cm, and the
  number of layers is now 20 (each with half lambda
  of absorber), and radially 10, with 1/4 lambda size.


8-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-02)
- Migration to PI_1_2_4 (so the temporary bug fix in 
  PI_1_2_3 has been removed).
  More automatization has been introduced: now it 
  builds the executable, and it is possible to run
  separately the simulation and the statistical tests.


3-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-01)
- Fully automatized.
