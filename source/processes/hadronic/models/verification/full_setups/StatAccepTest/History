20-Oct-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-02)
- Introduced the possibility to have magnetic field
  (only along the y-axis, i.e. transverse to the
   beam direction) in the Geant4 macros. Also some
  clean up of the information which are printed out.


13-Oct-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-01-01)
- Changes to ensure that the transportation in field
  is not used if the magnetic field is zero (which
  is the default value). Removed also all the 
  compilation warnings.


29-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-09)
- Change in observables.py in order to plot all
  beam energies even if not found in log files.
  The kumacs now plot as a function of the
  logarithm of the beam energy.


13-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-08)
- Change of the ordering of  pvalue.cpp  to avoid
  a bug in PI when reading ntuples from two files.


10-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-07)
- Preparing the version to be use for the June 
  release testing. Only few minor changes.


6-Jun-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-06)
- Preparing the version to be use for the June 
  release testing. Only a minor change in plot.py
  to pick  paw  from the installation.


29-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-05)
- The kumacs in dirObservables have been modified
  (and a minor modification in the python script
   as well) in order to use vectors directly for
  plotting rather than histograms as before (which
  requires unnatural binning along the x-axis).


29-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-04)
- Added a new sudirectory, dirObservables, which
  contains a python script and some kumacs useful
  to produce plots of various observables.


8-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-03)
- Added information useful to extract the response,
  energy resolution, and e/pi.


7-Apr-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-02)
- Included summary histograms for the longitudinal 
  and transverse shower profiles.


24-Mar-2005 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V07-00-01)
- Update for Geant4 7.0 .


6-Dec-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-06)
- Setup for running on the Grid.


16-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-05)
- Introduce a beam energy threshold (currently at
  10 GeV) below which no biasing are applied, and
  even the default tracking cut (700 mu) is used.
  Also added PbSci as another calorimeter type to be 
  tested (LHCb ECAL is a PbSci calorimeter).


10-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-04)
- Added biasing for the neutrons, and also two different
  level of biasing for gammas, electrons, and positrons.
  The binning of the later shape has been changed: now
  they are increasing as the radius grows, in such a way
  to keep enough statistics in spite of the rapid decrease
  of the shower with the radius. The default is 10 variable 
  bins, with the first one of size equal to 0.1 lambda.


9-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-03)
- Added biasing in electromagnetic physics (i.e. for
  gammas, electrons, and positrons). Also a cut on
  low energy neutrons has been added. Changed also
  the default production range cut, to 1 cm, and the
  number of layers is now 20 (each with half lambda
  of absorber), and radially 10, with 1/4 lambda size.


8-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-02)
- Migration to PI_1_2_4 (so the temporary bug fix in 
  PI_1_2_3 has been removed).
  More automatization has been introduced: now it 
  builds the executable, and it is possible to run
  separately the simulation and the statistical tests.


3-Nov-2004 - A.Ribon (statAccepTest-V06-02-01)
- Fully automatized.
