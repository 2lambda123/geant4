 In this directory you find a test for the Hadronic Cascade models
 of Geant4. More precisely, the BInary Cascade (BIC) and the Classical
 Bertini Cascade (BERT) models are considered here.

 By the default, BIC will be tested, via the Physics List QGSP_BIC;
 if you want to test BERT, via the Physics List QGSP_BERT, you have 
 simply to do the following:
       $  rm src/MyPhysicsList.cc
       $  ln -s src/MyPhysicsList.cc-QGSP_BERT src/MyPhysicsList.cc 

 This test consists of sending a single particle, of a given kinetic
 energy, into a sampling calorimeter.
  The absorber materials between which you can choose are:
     Iron, Copper, PbWO4, Lead, Tungsten, Uranium.
 The active materials between which you can choose are:
     Scintillator (Polystyrene), LiquidArgon, PbWO4, Silicon.
 (if you are interested in an homogeneous PbWO4 calorimeter, you can
  "emulate" it in this test as a PbWO4-PbWO4 sampling calorimeter!)

 The file  allCases50events.g4  is an example of a very long job
 (it lasts more than a week) in which various cases, of importance
 for LHC detectors, are considered:
     sampling calorimeters: Fe-Sci, Fe-LAr, Cu-Sci, Cu-LAr, 
                            PbWO4-PbWO4, WSi
     incident particles: pi-, pi+, K-, K+, K0S, K0L, p, n
     kinetic energy: 3.6, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 
                     120, 150, 180, 200, 300 GeV
 For each of these cases (Runs), 50 events are simulated.
 To run it, you have to do:   $  myMain allCases50events.g4
 where  myMain  is the executable that can be obtained my typing 
        $  gmake
 after having setup the Geant4 environmental variables, and AIDA.

 The subdirectory  batch/  has an example of how to run this test
 in the LSF lxplus batch system. Please read the README file in
 such subdirectory.
