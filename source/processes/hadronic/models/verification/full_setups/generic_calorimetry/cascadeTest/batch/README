 In this directory you can find an example of how to submit a 
 job in the LSF batch system of lxplus.

 1) You have to log in lxplus.

 2) commands.g4-CuLAr-proton-200 : is the Geant4 command macro
                                   that runs 5000 events, consisting
    of proton primary particle, with 200 GeV kinetic energy, into
    a Copper-LiquiArgon calorimeter.

 3) submit.sh-CuLAr-proton-200 : is the script which should be executed
                                 to submit the job in the queue.
    In this case, the "1-week-of-normalized time" queue is used.
   
 4) job.sh-CuLAr-proton-200 : is the script which will be executed
                              by the batch system. Notice that the
    path of the various files must be absolute (i.e. to have the
    full path).

 In the case you want to send a job for a different configuration
 (for instance pi- of 150 GeV into a Iron-Scintillator calorimeter)
 then you have simply to make minimal trivial changes to the above
 three files.
