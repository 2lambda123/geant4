       Hadronic Test Setup for Quasi-elastic Pion Scattering
       -----------------------------------------------------

	
 1- SET-UP
 
 	The geometry is simply a target disk 50 mm in radius with a variable 
        material and thickness.  A perfect, mono-energetic beam of pi- is 
        incident perpendicular to the target.  Once the incident particle is 
        scattered, or secondaries are produced, all tracks are stored and
        killed.  

 2-PHYSICS

        Only pi+ and pi- are defined for this test.  The LEP, Binary and
        Bertini cascade hadronic models are enabled, as well as the 
        transportation process.  The model used can be chosen by setting 
        an environment variable:

                 setenv TestBinary
                 setenv TestBertini
                 setenv TestLEP

 	    
 3-HOW TO USE
 
        Run the test with the following command:

        ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/pimquasi targtest.mac

        pimquasi is the executable code for scattering pi- from a target.

        targtest.mac contains parameters which can be changed by the user:

            /target/setTgtMat Lead      === set the target material
            /target/setTgtThick 5.0 mm  === set the target thickness


            /event/printModulo n        === print event # and random 
                                            seeds every n events


            /gun/particle pi-           === select pi- incident
            /gun/energy 820.6 MeV       === select incident particle energy
            /run/beamOn n               === run n events


       ASCII output files of cross section vs. pion energy loss are produced.
       They are named

                 Pi-quasi_821MeV_19_5deg.hist
                 Pi-quasi_821MeV_30deg.hist
                 Pi-quasi_821MeV_42deg.hist

       where the angles represent the center of the 5 degree angular bins in 
       which the outgoing pion was collected.

 
 4-DATA

       The Monte Carlo output files may be compared to the data files in the
       /data directory.  These data are taken from 

       Y. Fujii et al., Phys. Rev. C64, 034608 (2001).
