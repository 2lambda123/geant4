12 Jun 2003 Gabriele Cosmo (radiative_decay-V05-01-00)
- Fix in G4ITDecayChannel.hh and G4RadioactiveDecay.cc for porting
  on Windows .NET compiler: changed signature in constructor for
  G4ITDecayChannel to use G4Ions instead of G4ParticleDefinition.

03 Jan 2003 Fan Lei
- bug (test18) fix in G4NuclearDecayChannel.cc

15 Nov 2002 Fan Lei ((radiative_decay-V04-01-01)
- Added linked to atomic relaxation model after EC and
  IT/IC(internal conversion).
- updated GNUMakefile to include electromagnetic/lowenergy/include
- Updated the database

13 Nov 2001 Fan Lei (radiative_decay-V03-02-03)
- Minor bug fix

26 Oct 2001 Fan Lei (radiative_decay-V03-02-02)
- Removal of compilation warnings under gcc 2.95.2
- Bug fixing for beta+ decay (wrong Q value was used)

20 Apr 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (radiative_decay-V03-01-00)
- Modified G4RadioactiveDecay.cc according to recent migration to STL vector
  for the geometry domain (tag "geometry-V03-01-00").

01 Nov 2000 Fan Lei (radiative_decay-V02-00-02)
- added the missing line " ee = e0+1.; " to line 763 in 
  G4RadioactiveDecay.cc
 
27th Oct 200   fan Lei  (radiative_decay-V02-00-01)
- add a fast simulation mode for beta decays

25th Oct 2000  fan lei  (radiative_decay-V02-00-00)
- added 'const' to line 1185 of G4RadioactiveDecay.cc to cowork with 
  tag Track-V02-00-00

27th June 2000  Fan Lei  (radiative_decay-V01-01-04)
- fix for DEC-cxx debug non-ISO.
- update test log files.

15th June 2000  Fan Lei (radiative_decay_V01-01-03)
