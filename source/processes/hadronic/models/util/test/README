Unit tests for hadronic/models/util classes.

Note: Several of these tests still use hbook via obsolete CLHEP interface, may
need conversion first to run these. 

NucleonTest.cc
 
NucleusTest.cc
 Test printing static info for nuclei, and some average quantities of created
 3DNuclei.
  
NucleusTest2.cc   
 Test to verify density and momentum distributions. (creates histograms)

NucleusTest3.cc
 Test to verify density and momentum distributions. (creates histograms)

NucleusTest4.cc
 Simple test instantiating -or Init()- a nucleus for _all_ isotopes 
 for all elements, a number of times(current repeat=500)

KineticTrackTest.cc


hbfinit.f :        obsolete, used with hbook
