HADRONICS   by aatos.heikkinen@cern.ch 070510
========= 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Hadronics testing facility is based on Geant4 advanced/hadrontherapy example. (see README file)

PUROPOSE
The program is to be used in validation and comparison of different Geant4 hadronics models,
such as pre-equilibrium (pre-compund) models and evaporation models.


HISTOGRAMMING
variable G4ANALYSIS_USE_ROOT is used to activate ROOT based histogramming.
(ROOTSYS needs to be defined)

Original histogramming is done using AIDA compilant histogramming tool (variable G4ANALYSIS_USE)

Please refer to README file on when setting up other system variables. .


EXAMPLE

hadronics.mac is run by default
 - Physics bertini with internal pre-compound and evaporation
 - we shoot protons to thin lead target (was  water phantom in original hadrontherapy example) 


REQUIREMENTS
Currenversion of Hadronics has been tested with:
- geant4.8.1.p01
- ROOT 5.15/02 (flag G4ANALYSIS_USE_ROOT)
- Asymptote 1.26 (plotting with)
