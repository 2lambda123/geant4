We present here a intranuclear cascade model implemented in {\sc Geant4 5.0}. 
The cascade model is based on re-engineering of INUCL code.
Models included are Bertini intra-nuclear cascade model with exitons, pre-equilibrium model, nucleus explosion model, 
fission model, and evaporation model.
Intermediate energy nuclear reactions from 100~MeV to 5~GeV energy are treated for proton, neutron, pions, photon and nuclear isotopes.
We represent overview of the models, review results achived from simulations and make comparisons with experimental data.
