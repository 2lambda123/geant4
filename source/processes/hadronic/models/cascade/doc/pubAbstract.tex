This document describes Monte Carlo simulation of intermediate energy nuclear reactions of hadronic cascade models in {\sc Geant4}.
These models are based on re-engineering of High Energy Transport Code (HETC) and INUCL codes.
Models treated are  Bertini intra-nuclear cascade models, fission models, pre-equilibrium, and evaporation models.
We represent model overviews, results achived from simulations and make comparisons with measurements.
