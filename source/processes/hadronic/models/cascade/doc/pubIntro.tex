\subsection{Hadronic Models Framework in Geant4}


% Geant4 is a Monte Carlo particle detector simulation toolkit for
% various computing platforms and en\-vi\-ron\-ments\cite{G4UserRequirements}.
% In order to match the needs of the LHC in high energy physics
% community. Other requirements are also set by medical and space
% science applications. Geant4 has been developed by a world-wide collaboration of over 40
% institutions~\cite{wellisch99,MoURD44}.  
% The objectives of the Geant4 development project are to redesign and
% re-engineer the major CERN software tool Geant3.21 for an Object Oriented (OO) environment. 

% Geant4 collaboration websites \cite{webG4INFN}.


% Geant4 exploits advanced Software Engineering techniques and Object
% Oriented technology to achieve the transparency of the physics
% implementation and to this way provide the possibility of validating the
% physics results. The stringent requirements~\cite{wellisch99} of the
% LHC and other future experiments require from the hadronic simulation framework a high
% level of flexibility, customizability, extendibility and transparency,
% which can be attained only by a systematic OO software engineering
% approach. Easy maintenance and distributed development are also
% important issues for the framework design.

% The hadronic models framework is based on concepts of physics
% processes and models. While the process is a general concept, models
% are allowed to have restrictions in process type, material, element
% and energy range.  Several models can be utilized by one model class; for instance, a
% process class for inelastic collisions can use distinct models for different energies.

% Geant4 provides a flexible framework for the modular implementation of
% various kinds of hadronic interactions.  There are distinct process
% classes for different type of interactions (i.e. elastic and
% inelastic).  Process classes utilize model classes to determine the
% secondaries produced in the interaction and to calculate the momenta
% of the particles.  Several model classes for different particles and
% energy regimes can be used by the process classes. 

% Geant4 process classes contain two kinds of important methods used in
% tracking: {\it GetPhysicalInteractionLength} (GPIL) and {\it
%   DoIt}.  The {\it GPIL} method gives the step length from the current
% space-time position to the next space-time point where the {\it DoIt}
% method is invoked to describe what happens in the interaction.  It
% describes the change of energy and momentum direction, change of
% position and secondary tracks by returning an instance of the class {\it G4VParticleChange}.

% All physics process classes are derived from the class {\it G4VProcess}. It
% has three pure virtual {\it DoIt} methods: {\it PostStepDoIt},
% {\it AlongStepDoIt} and {\it AtRestDoIt}.

% These methods return {\it G4VParticleChange} classes. 
% {\it G4VProcess} also has corresponding pure virtual GPIL
% methods, which return a {\it G4double} for the interaction length. There are
% also some other pure virtual methods common for all physics processes.

% For simple processes, there are base classes such as {\it
%   G4VRestProcess}, {\it G4VContinuous\-Process} and {\it G4VDiscrete\-Process}
% available. In these classes only one of the above mentioned {\it DoIt}
% methods is active. The {\it DoIt} method returns an instance of
% ``Particle Change'' class (derived from {\it G4VParticleChange}),
% which is responsible for updating the step class {\it G4Step} used in
% tracking.

% All hadronic process objects are derived from the abstract class {\it
%   G4Hadronic\.Process} (which itself is derived from {\it
%   G4VDis\-crete\-Process} and {\it G4VProcess}), and have one or more
% cross-section data sets associated with them. These objects
% encapsulate methods and data for calculating total cross-sections for
% a given process. The default cross-sections can be overridden in whole
% or in part (for certain materials and energy regimes) by the user.
% Thus the cross-sections and physical models are implemented independently.

% The Geant4 hadronic model framework allows flexible use of several models
% without the need for the implementation of a special interface. 
% This way, highly specialised models can be easily used in the same
% application together with more general code. Forexample, models wich
% are valid only for one material and particle and applicable only in a restricted energy range.

% Geant4 models can be divided into parametrisation driven, data driven and
%theory driven models~\cite{privAmelin, wellisch99}.
% In parametrisation driven models, the existing data for hadronic
% reactions and energies is parametrized for generating the final
% state. In Geant4, inelastic scattering models based on this paradigm are
% available for low and high particle energies.

% Data driven models are typically used in Geant4 for the simulation of
% nuclear low energy neutron scattering.  It is also used in the
% simulation of the absorption of some particle coming to rest. When the data
% coverage is not sufficient other types of models are used.

% Theory driven models are available in Geant4 for inelastic scattering
% in a first implementation, covering the full energy range of LHC
% experiments (up to $\rm14~TeV$). Theory driven models are used to
% extract the missing cross-sections from the measured ones, or at high
% energies to predict the cross-sections by using the Regge theory.
