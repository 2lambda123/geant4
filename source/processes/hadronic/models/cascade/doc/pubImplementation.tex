\section{Implementation}

% \subsection{{\sc Geant4} hadronic framework}

Cascade model is implemented in {\sc Geant4} directory ({\it geant4/ source/ processes/ hadronic/ models/ cascade/ cascade/})
All the models are used collectively through interface method {\it ApplyYourself} defined in class {\it G4CascadeInteface}.
The method requires as a parameters a {\sc Geant4} track  ({\it G4Track}) and a nucleus ({\it G4Nucleus}). 

We have tested the cascade models for its first release in {\sc Geant4 5.0}, for energies 100~MeV -- 5~GeV. 
Detailed comparisons with experimental data has been made in energy range 160 -- 800 MeV.
