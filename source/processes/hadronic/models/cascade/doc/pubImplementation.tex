\section{Implementation}

% \subsection{{\sc Geant4} hadronic framework}

Cascade model is implemented in {\sc Geant4} hadronic physics framework. Source code directory is {\it geant4/\-source/\-processes/\-hadronic/\-models/\-cascade/\-cascade}.
All the models are used collectively through interface method {\it Apply\-Yourself} defined in a class {\it G4Cascade\-Inteface}.
{\sc Geant4} track  ({\it G4Track}) and a nucleus ({\it G4Nucleus}) are given as a parameters.

We have tested the cascade models for its first release in {\sc Geant4 5.0}, for energies 100~MeV -- 5~GeV. 
Detailed comparisons with experimental data has been made in energy range 160 -- 800 MeV.
