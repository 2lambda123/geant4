\section{Acknowledgements}

I greatly acknowledge following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hans-Peter Wellich privided me the testing fremework of Geant4 hadronic physics. He also tested the code and helped with the interfacing.
\item Tapio Lamp\'{e}n (Geant4 collaborator) re-write HETC evaporation and de-exitation code.
\item Nikita Stepanov provided the INUCL code.
\item Joe Chuma translated HETC pre-equilibrium exiton medel from F77 to C++.
\item Cristian Zeitznits provided me original HETC manuals and gave useful advices conserning GCALOR interface.
\item Laura Tillikainen, who worked as summer trainee, rewrite some of the HETC routines, 
especially those related to the cross-sections.
\end{itemize}

Funding from CERN IT/API for my travel to Vancouver, Canada and CERN is greatly appreciated.

I would like also to acknowledgements Veikko Karimaki, my supervisor, 
who originally introduced me to Geant4 and gave opportunity to work on this project. 
He was also responsibe together with Jorma Tuomiemi (HIP CB representative), 
when Helsinki Institute of Physics joined Geant4 collaboration.


Finally in acnowledge my colleagues Antti Honkanen, Pertti Aarnio and Mika Huhtinen for their useful advice concerning Geant4 and hadronic simulations in general.
