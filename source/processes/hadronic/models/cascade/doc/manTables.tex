\begin{itemize}
\item {\it NR} Nuclear reaction
\item {\it quasi-elastic reaction} NR where nucleon can be knocked out of its nuclear. 
%[quasi-elastic cross section] The physical interpretation of the
%quasi-elastic cross section is the following: besides the true
%elastics scattering (often called {\em coherent-elastic} there are
%contributions coming from interactions where the nucleus is no longer
%left in the ground state, but still no elementary inelastic h-N
%interactions accured.

\item {\it T-nucleus} Target nucleus
