\section{Conclusion}

Implementation of evaporation and de-excitation has been done according to the
OO principles is now ready and can be integrate to Geant4 hadronic
model framework

In evaporation model different MC results compared to old Fortan
version come from statistical fluctuations, 
but also from changement of constants and energy algorithm, 
quite large differe
nces with light $^{16}$O, fission not considered

INC and pre-equilibrium models are now largely translated to
C++. OOA\&D need to be finished before results are available from
these modules.
