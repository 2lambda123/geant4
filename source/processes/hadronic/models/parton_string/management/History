9-July-2009 V. Uzhinsky     (had-partonstring-mgt-V08-02-02)
- New field was added in G4VSplitableHadron class (G4 bool Activation) and 
  corresponding methods to operatite with it. It was needed for an 
  absorption of meson in nuclear collision generated by FTF.

24-Apr 2007 Gunter Folger   (had-partonstring-mgt-V08-02-01)
- Merge ftf-dev back to head.


24-Jan 2007 G.Folger			Tag : had-partonstring-mgt-V08-02-00
   - Debugging method Dump added in G4InteractionContent to print object
   - Debug output in G4VPartonStringModel checking E-p conservation of string
     model

31-March-2008 V. Uzhinsky               Tag : had-partonstring-mgt-V09-01-00
  - G4FTFCrossSection.cc and G4FTFCrossSection.hh were re-named into
    G4FTFParameters.cc and .hh, and moved to diffraction directory.
    The corresponding class was re-named too. All of these characterize 
    the content of the files more exactly.
