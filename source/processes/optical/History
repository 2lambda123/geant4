                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

31st August 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-02-00)
- G4OpRayleigh.hh, G4OpBoundary.hh and G4OpAbsorption.hh: changed processName
                   to 'OpRayleigh', 'OpBoundary' and 'OpAbsorption' respectively

30th January 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-00-05)
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: allow for positiv and negative CosTheta and force the
                   new momentum direction to be in the same plane as the
                   new and old polarization vectors
                   still bug report: 207

29th January 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-00-04)
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: fix calculation of SinTheta from CosTheta
                   bug report: 207

23rd January 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-00-02)
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: Allow for Rayleigh scattering length to be defined for 
           arbitrary material through the use of G4MaterialPropertyTable.

5th October 2000  Peter Gumplinger (op-V02-00-02)
- G4OpAbsorption.cc: Comment out warning - No Absorption length specified.

3rd August 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (op-V02-00-00r)
- G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc: changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss to fix problem
  of events' reproducibility.
- Syncronized with HEAD (only CVS headers changes).

21th October 1999  Peter Gumplinger (op-V00-01-01)
- G4OpBoundaryProcess.hh and G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc have been modified
  (Fill NewMomentum/NewPolarization in DoAbsorption. These members need
  to be filled since DoIt calls aParticleChange.SetMomentumChange etc.
  upon return (thanks to: Clark McGrew)
