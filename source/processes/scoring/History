November 20th A.Howard (procscore-V08-01-01)
- added biasing and related scoring classes, 1st implementation to new parallel
  implementation
- two examples B01_para and B02_para - translated from B01 and B02

November 13th  M.Asai (procscore-V08-01-00)
- Corresponds to the change of G4PathFinder::ComputeStep.

November 8th  M.Asai
- Use the new G4VUserPhysicsList::AddTransportation() which
  automatically replace G4Transporation with G4CoupledTransportation
  if a parallel world is defined.

November 6th  J.Allison
- test1:
  o Made top world volumes invisible.
  o Improved vis.mac.

November 3rd  J.Allison
- test1: Simple vis.mac to illustrate visualisation of parallel worlds.
  Execute with just two parameters, for example:
    ParaTest para disp

November 2nd  J.Allison
- test1:
  o Replaced A01VisManager by G4VisExecutive.
  o Introduced vis.mac.
