- clean up againist Linux ANSI strict compilation mode.
    
16 may 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-01-00)
- value of the member cpar has been changed back to the original
  value 1.5 in G4MultipleScattering.cc. The same is done in
  G4MultipleScatteringx.cc (the data member name is cparm there).
  This change affects all the results for low energy (< 1 MeV
  for electrons).
  
15 may 01: L.Urban
- new multiple scattering version committed under the class name
  G4MultipleScatteringx. It gives better msc angle distribution
  than the standard G4MultipleScattering. It uses a distribution
  to simulate the geom./true pathlengths (standard : mean values
  only) and has a framework implemented in it to perform special
  stepping near to a boundary (this algorithm works, but some
  further development/tuning needed - this algorithm is disabled
  by default). This new version can be used after the change:
       G4MultipleScattering  --> G4MultipleScatteringx 
  in the PhysicsList. 
     
27 mar 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-06)
- another bug fixed in G4VEnergyLoss.cc, in the fluct code.

  distribution in the case of small cut value, the distribution
  was too narrow....
     
16 jan 01: mma (utils-V03-00-00)
- bug fixed in MultipleScattering.cc L.Urban 11-01-01

  low energy (below few MeV for electrons)
