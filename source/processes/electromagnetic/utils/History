                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

27 mar 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-06)
- another bug fixed in G4VEnergyLoss.cc , in the fluct code.
  The code gave in some cases (very rarely) small negative energy loss
  for small (~ micrometer) step size , now it is cured.

23 mar 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-05)
- bug fixed in fluct in G4VEnergyLoss.cc
  Some int internal variables have been changed to doubles,
  anomaly at extreme high energy/high cut (zero energy deposit)
  is cured.
     
05 mar 01 mma (utils-V03-00-04)
- new subdirectory: integral
  migration of all G4I.. processes from muons, standard, utils into integral
     
01 feb 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-01)
- bug fixed in the fluctuation code , in G4VEnergyLoss.cc
  This bug affected the width of the energy loss/energy deposit
  distribution in the case of small cut value, the distribution
  was too narrow....
     
16 jan 01: mma (utils-V03-00-00)
- bug fixed in MultipleScattering.cc L.Urban 11-01-01 
  there was an error in computation of the transport
  cross section, the cross section was too small for
  low energy (below few MeV for electrons)
    
09 nov 00: mma (utils-V02-00-04)
- G4EnergyLossMessenger : subdirectory /process/eLoss created 
  + class description
       
04 nov 00: mma (utils-V02-00-03)
- EnergyLossTable: const G4Material* in all functions
- G4VEnergyLoss and Messenger slighy modified for more flexibility
  only (Laszlo)
     
11 aug 00: mma (utils-V02-00-01)

03 aug 00: gc
- fixed problem for event reproducibility: changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss
  in G4VEnergyLoss.cc. Needs tag "global-V02-00-02" to cowork with.

22 jun 00: mma  (utils-V01-01-03)
- muls: do not nuclear size correction for electron
- move Eloss messenger --> G4VEnergyLoss
          
24 may 00: mma  (utils-V01-01-02)
- merge "plus" processes into standard      
     
27 apr 00 mma  (em-V01-01-01)
- G4endl (dec/iso)      
     
26 apr 00 mma  (em-V01-01-00)
- all EnergyLoss classes renamed G4V... 
  Most classes in standard and muons affected.
- G4Muls moved in utils
- bugs fixe in MuPairProduction  
- cowork with geant4-01-01-ref-02
     
02 mar 00 mma  (em-V01-00-00)
- new G4VEnergyLoss class and related structure
- cowork with geant4-01-00-ref-06
     
10 nov 99 mma  (em-V00-01-03)
- migration to STL: remove RWT hash dictionnary

14th June 1999  John Allison (em-01-00-05b)
- Muon corrections in G4MultipleScattering.cc, G4MuBremsstrahlung.cc
  and G4MuPairProduction.cc by Laszlo Urban, Pedro Arce.
  (Also in rocesses/photoleplon_hadron/src/G4MuNuclearInteraction.cc.)

5th June 1999  John Allison
- standard/GNUmakefile: Force non-optimised compliation of some
  files on HP with aCC: HP ANSI C++ B3910B A.01.15.

May 29, 1999: John Allison
- Added electromagnetic/lowenergy to GNUmakefile and
  electromagnetic/GNUmakefile..
