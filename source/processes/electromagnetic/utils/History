This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

14 feb 02: L.Urban (utils-V04-00-01)
- initial value of data member of G4VEnergyLoss finalRange
  has been changed
  (actual value of this data member is computed in
   G4VeEnergyLoss,G4VhEnergyLoss and G4VMuEnergyLoss..)

11 feb 02: mma (utils-V04-00-00)
- subSecFlag = false --> No sucutoff generation
    
08 nov 01: mma (utils-V03-02-11)
- G4VEnergyLoss: some data members and functions are no more static
     
07 nov 01: mma (utils-V03-02-10)
- bug fixe in G4MultipleScattering::PostStepDoIt()
     
29 oct 01: mma (utils-V03-02-09)
- static functions no more inlined
     
24 oct 01: mma (utils-V03-02-08)
- cut per material: G4VEnergyLoss
     
28 sep 01: mma (utils-V03-02-07)
- StorePhysicsTable: ParticleName included in FileName

27 sep 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-02-06)
-  bug fixed in G4EnergyLossTables.icc,.cc:
   this bug caused sometime negative energy deposit
   (it was a very-very old bug)
-  value of data member factlim in msc has been changed

19 sep 01: mma (utils-V03-02-05)
- come back to previous process name: "msc"
     
17 sep 01: mma (utils-V03-02-04)
- modifs in muls and VEnergyLoss for the migration of Materials to pure STL,
  but backward compatible with g4rw 
         
 13 sep 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-02-03)
- Unused TrueToGeomTransformation method deleted. Class description
- corr. in ComputeTransportCrossSection
    
 11 sep 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-02-02)
- G4MultipleScatteringx put as the default: G4MultipleScattering
     
 11 sep 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-02-01)
- last tag with G4MultipleScatteringx file. 
    
 03 sep 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-02-00)
- value of data member factlim has been changed.
     
 28 aug 01: mma
- G4MultipleScatteringx: small modifs in BuildPhysicsTable,
  ComputeTransportCrossSection, PostStepDoIt. 
  GetContinuousStepLimit and AlongStepDoIt moved to .cc file

 23 aug 01: L. Urban
- new angle and z(geom. pathlength) distributions,
  energy (step) dependence has been reduced,
  Store/Retrieve methods have been commented out temporarily
     
 8 aug 01: mma
- G4MultipleScatteringx: methods to store/retrieve PhysicsTable

18 may 01: V.Ivanchenko (utils-V03-01-01)
- clean up againist Linux ANSI strict compilation mode.
    
16 may 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-01-00)
- value of the member cpar has been changed back to the original
  value 1.5 in G4MultipleScattering.cc. The same is done in
  G4MultipleScatteringx.cc (the data member name is cparm there).
  This change affects all the results for low energy (< 1 MeV
  for electrons).
  
15 may 01: L.Urban
- new multiple scattering version committed under the class name
  G4MultipleScatteringx. It gives better msc angle distribution
  than the standard G4MultipleScattering. It uses a distribution
  to simulate the geom./true pathlengths (standard : mean values
  only) and has a framework implemented in it to perform special
  stepping near to a boundary (this algorithm works, but some
  further development/tuning needed - this algorithm is disabled
  by default). This new version can be used after the change:
       G4MultipleScattering  --> G4MultipleScatteringx 
  in the PhysicsList. 
     
27 mar 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-06)
- another bug fixed in G4VEnergyLoss.cc, in the fluct code.
  The code gave in some cases (very rarely) small negative energy loss
  for small (~ micrometer) step size, now it is cured.

23 mar 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-05)
- bug fixed in fluct in G4VEnergyLoss.cc
  Some int internal variables have been changed to doubles,
  anomaly at extreme high energy/high cut (zero energy deposit)
  is cured.
     
05 mar 01 mma (utils-V03-00-04)
- new subdirectory: integral
  migration of all G4I.. processes from muons, standard, utils into integral
     
01 feb 01: L.Urban (utils-V03-00-01)
- bug fixed in the fluctuation code , in G4VEnergyLoss.cc
  This bug affected the width of the energy loss/energy deposit
  distribution in the case of small cut value, the distribution
  was too narrow....
     
16 jan 01: mma (utils-V03-00-00)
- bug fixed in MultipleScattering.cc L.Urban 11-01-01 
  there was an error in computation of the transport
  cross section, the cross section was too small for
  low energy (below few MeV for electrons)
    
09 nov 00: mma (utils-V02-00-04)
- G4EnergyLossMessenger : subdirectory /process/eLoss created 
  + class description
       
04 nov 00: mma (utils-V02-00-03)
- EnergyLossTable: const G4Material* in all functions
- G4VEnergyLoss and Messenger slighy modified for more flexibility
  only (Laszlo)
     
11 aug 00: mma (utils-V02-00-01)

03 aug 00: gc
- fixed problem for event reproducibility: changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss
  in G4VEnergyLoss.cc. Needs tag "global-V02-00-02" to cowork with.

22 jun 00: mma  (utils-V01-01-03)
- muls: do not nuclear size correction for electron
- move Eloss messenger --> G4VEnergyLoss
          
24 may 00: mma  (utils-V01-01-02)
- merge "plus" processes into standard      
     
27 apr 00 mma  (em-V01-01-01)
- G4endl (dec/iso)      
     
26 apr 00 mma  (em-V01-01-00)
- all EnergyLoss classes renamed G4V... 
  Most classes in standard and muons affected.
- G4Muls moved in utils
- bugs fixe in MuPairProduction  
- cowork with geant4-01-01-ref-02
     
02 mar 00 mma  (em-V01-00-00)
- new G4VEnergyLoss class and related structure
- cowork with geant4-01-00-ref-06
     
10 nov 99 mma  (em-V00-01-03)
- migration to STL: remove RWT hash dictionnary

14th June 1999  John Allison (em-01-00-05b)
- Muon corrections in G4MultipleScattering.cc, G4MuBremsstrahlung.cc
  and G4MuPairProduction.cc by Laszlo Urban, Pedro Arce.
  (Also in rocesses/photoleplon_hadron/src/G4MuNuclearInteraction.cc.)

5th June 1999  John Allison
- standard/GNUmakefile: Force non-optimised compliation of some
  files on HP with aCC: HP ANSI C++ B3910B A.01.15.

May 29, 1999: John Allison
- Added electromagnetic/lowenergy to GNUmakefile and
  electromagnetic/GNUmakefile..
