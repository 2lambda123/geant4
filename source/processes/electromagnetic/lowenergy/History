22.11.2000 - Bug fixed in electron energy fluctuations
             V.Ivanchenko

21.11.2000 - MGP, tag emlowen-V02-00-20
	     Same as emlowen-V02-00-18, Vladimir's fix to energy fluctuations
             (All this duplication of emlowen tags is due to the fact that the 
             electromagnetic/utils tag with the interface updates contains
             also bug fixes and new features, and such tag has not passed
             system testing yet)

17.09.2000 - MGP, tag emlowen-V02-00-09
             New features on antiproton ionisation by Stephane Chauvie:
             extension of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator model to
             generic materials, calculation of oscillator strengths for 
             all elements
             Antiproton model also moved to be compliant with the new design
             iteration

16.09.2000 - MGP, tag emlowen-V02-00-08	
             Const cast in G4hLowEnergyIonisation (const G4Material* into
             G4Material*) to convert the previously _good_ LowE code 
             into bad one, but palatable to G4EnergyLossTables, that has 
             various member functions requiring a non-const G4Material* 
	     pointer in the arguments
             This modification was required to avoid compilation errors
             on DEC; it is meant to be temporary
             The affected pointers SHOULD BE REVERTED TO CONST 
             AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, after agreement with the 
             G4EnergyLossTables author

	     to remove compilation problems on DEC (uninitialized variable)
             Fix in G4hLowEnergyLoss, eliminated two protected variables
             G4Proton* theProton and G4AntiProton* theAntiProton 
             to revove compilation problems on DEC (hiding)

16.09.2000 - MGP, tag emlowen-V02-00-06

             for better understanding of the code)
