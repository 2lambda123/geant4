/* \brief {The transportation method implemented is the one from
 *         Ermak-McCammon : J. Chem. Phys. 69, 1352 (1978).
 *         To compute time and space intervals to reach a volume boundary,
 *         there are two alternative methods proposed by this process.
 *         Currently by default, the accurate method is disabled because the
 *         navigation system may return very small space distances which do not
 *         correspond to the actual distance to the next boundary and therefore
 *         slows down the entire simulation. As a consequence, the second method
 *         is used. Once the navigation will return accurate distances to the
 *         next boundaries, the first and accurate method will be reactivated.
 *
 *         The method currently used selects a minimum distance to the next
 *         boundary using to the following formula:
 *         t_min = (geometryStepLength * geometryStepLength) / (8 * diffusionCoefficient);
 *
 *         Currently if the minimum time step reaches the lower time limit defined by the user
 *         in G4ITScheduler, the minimum user time step is selected. As a consequence, the
 *         Brownian object may jump over volume boundaries and therefore forbidden materials.
 *         This is something to take into account when you set up your simulation.
 *
 *         The first and accurate method can randomly compute the time to the
 *         next boundary using the following formula:
 *         t_random = 1 / (4 * diffusionCoefficient)* pow(geometryStepLength / InvErfc(G4UniformRand()),2);
 *         At each diffusion step, the direction of the particle is selected randomly.
 *         For now, the geometryStepLength corresponds to the distance to the
 *         nearest boundary along the direction selected randomly.
 *
 *         This method is currently deactivated by default for the reason mentionned earlier.
 *         }
