                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

- G4AdjointAlongStepWeightCorrection: get rid of call to non-Standard isnan(),
  replaced by explicit validity test.  

12 Apr 2010: V.Ivanchenko (emadjoint-V09-03-00)
- G4AdjointhMultipleScattering: removed obsolete unused header.

23 Nov 2009: G.Cosmo (emadjoint-V09-02-02)
- Corrected compilation error on Windows for G4AdjointAlongStepWeightCorrection.

20 Nov 2009: L.Desorgher (emadjoint-V09-02-01)

10 Nov 2009: L.Desorgher (emadjoint-V09-02-00)
- Commit of the electromagnetic  adjoint processes for the release of the all adjoint machinery into Geant4.
  Compared to the first commit, all e- processes have been improved and adjoint proton and ion ionisation have been added.
  The use of adjoint cross section matrices can be now limited only to e- Ionisation and Ion ionisation. 
  The GNUmakefile has been modified by adding  -I$(G4BASE)/geometry/navigation/include  in CPPFLAGS.
