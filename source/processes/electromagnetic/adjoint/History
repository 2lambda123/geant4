- Commit of the electromagnetic  adjoint processes for the release of the all adjoint machinery into Geant4.
  Compared to the first commit, all e- processes have been improved and adjoint proton and ion ionisation have been added.
  The use of adjoint cross section matrices can be now limited only to e- Ionisation and Ion ionisation. 
  The GNUmakefile has been modified by adding  -I$(G4BASE)/geometry/navigation/include  in CPPFLAGS.
