This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

16 jan 01: mma (stand-V03-00-00)
- small corrections in e/hEnergyLoss.cc L.Urban 11-01-01
  to ensure consistency between cut in range and step limitation
  due to energy loss (finalRange data member <-> cut in range)
- change in energy loss computation in eBrems.hh and .cc L.Urban 11-01-01
  parametrization of energy loss due to soft brems has been corrected,
  it was too big for big cut values.

   Class G4ionIonisation is removed. 

03 Aug 00 Gabriele Cosmo

  o G4GammaConversion.cc: changed usage of RandFlat::shootBit() to
    RandBit::shootBit().
  o G4VIeEnergyLoss.cc, G4VIhEnergyLoss.cc, G4PAIxSectionTest.cc:
    changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss.

31 Jul 00 Gonzalo Gracia
- G4IhIonisation.cc: initialisisation to zero of several  G4PhysicsTable*
