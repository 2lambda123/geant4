<h2><font color="#0000FF">Geometry </font></h2>
The geometry is a cylinder of 5 cm radius filled with C6F6. It is designed to
test the 'low' energy processes, i.e. below 10 MeV.<br>
The <a href="view.ps">pictures</a>
show the cylinder.<br><br>
The incident particle is a gamma of 9 Mev, randomly shooted at the center 
of the thank.<br>
Most of the time, the gamma skips the tank without interact. When it interacts, 
by gamma conversion or Compton scattering, the emitted charged particles
deposit their energy in C6F6.<br>  
Here 1000 events are surimposed. Only the tracks of charged particles are drawn. 

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Histogram </font></h2>
  The <a href="run01.04jun99.g4g3.ps">histogram</a> shows the energy
  deposited in C6F6 running 100000 events<br><br>
