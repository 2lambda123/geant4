 testem5.cra is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm5

 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version)

 To execute:

 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem5.xb (for batch) 

 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:

 run01.dat      (runNN.dat is the equivalent of the G4 runNN.mac)

 data cards:  most of the data cards used in runxx.dat are
 ----------   standard data cards of GEANT3, but some of them
              are defined in testem5.cra. These latter cards are:

              KEY      TYPE        Short description

              NAME   character     name of the hist.file <******* 

              ZABS    real         z size of the absorber
              RABS    real         radius of the absorber
              MATA    integer      mat.number of the absorber

              NH1     integer      number of bins in 1-st histogram
              HI1     real,real    lower/upper limit in 1-st histogram
              .......
              NH10     integer      nb of bins in 10-th hist.
              HI10    real,real     lower/upper limit in 10-th hist.


   ******>  the NAME data card should be the first , with the format
              A4,A2,A25.

   all the others are the so called free format data records used
   in GEANT3 .

   materials: the materials used in this test are defined in
   ---------  testem5.cra with materialnumbers 21 - 30 (see testem5.cra).
