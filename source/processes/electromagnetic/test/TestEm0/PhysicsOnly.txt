This test case is created to optimise the speed of the pure e.m. physics processes.
The runs and timings are taken on sp017.
A dedicated program is created both in G4 and G3 to compare and optimise.



CONDITIONS

1 + "Infinite" medium, so that the full shower developes without leakage and very far
    from any boundary so that safety is always much larger than the physics steps.

2 + HepJamesRandom generator in G4.

3 + No energy loss randomization of the step.

4 + Comparison of threshold value for triggering automatic STMIN in G3 vs the value
    coming from the new analytical formula in G4 (G3=170micron; G4=170micron).

5 + Make sure that in G3 the data cards IABAN = 0, ELOSS = 1, DRAY = 1, and AUTO = 1.

6 + All the cuts in G3 must be 10 KeV (including DCUTE and BCUTE). The cuts in range
    of G4 must be corresponding to 10 KeV.

7 + All gamma processes must be compared one by one (making the others inactive).

8 + All e+/e- processes must be compared one by one, starting from pure continuous
    components (checking to have the same contributors number) and after adding the 
    discrete components one by one.

9 + Eliminate any tracking overhead, checking with geantinos first; this means checking
    that no user max_step_length is limiting the step, that no hits are recorded or
    related function call overhead exist, checking that there are no user actions call 
    overheads, and no trajectories related overhead; also exploit preprocessor flags to
    eliminate all IF statements related to debug, verbose, and trajectories.
    
10- Eliminate any geometry overhead: 
    +optimised update of TOF when no integral approach;
    +no geometry invokation if physics steps smaller than safety; 
    -no relocation at every step; 
    +update of specialized particle change to cope with relocation needs; 
    -run geometry/benchmarks/calorimeter.cc to confirm pure geometry benchmarks.



OUTPUT

-> Number of steps

-> Number of each process invokation

-> Number of total secondaries produced

-> time

-> number of sqrt and log and exp
