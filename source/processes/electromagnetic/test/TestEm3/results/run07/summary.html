<p>
In Geant4 the threshold for producing secondaries are expressed in range,
 universal for all medium. This range is converted in energy for each kind 
 of particle and each material.<br>
 We illustrate here the advantages of this procedure.
</p>
 
<h2><font color="#0000FF">Description </font></h2>
The setup is a sandwich of non-dense and dense materials:
<p align=center>Liquid Argon(4 mm)--Lead(4 mm)--Liquid Argon(4 mm)--Lead(4 mm)</p>
The incident particle is a ionising particle: proton of 500 MeV.<br>
The threshold to produce delta-rays is 1.5 mm. For an electron, it means:
</p>
<table border width=90%>
  <tr align=center>
  <th>Threshold in range<th>e- Energy in Liquid Argon<th>e- Energy in Lead</tr>
  <tr align=center><td> 1.5 mm<td> 455 keV<td> 2 MeV<br></tr>
</table>
<p>
On the <a href="g4view.eps">picture</a>, one can see the delta-rays
produced and travelling in Liquid Argon, while nothing in produced in Lead.<br>
(on purpose the multiple scattering is off, and 1000 events are surimposed)
</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Geant3 </font></h2>
On Geant3 one must set the cut for delta-rays (DCUTE) either to the Liquid
Argon value, and producing many small unnecessary d-rays in Lead, or to the
Lead value, and killing the d-rays production everywhere.

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Stability of results </font></h2>
<p>
It should be noticed that the relevant physics quantities are quite stable
versus the production threshold, both in Geant4 and in Geant3.
</p>
<table border width=90%>
  <tr align=center>
  <th>Threshold in range<th>Edep in lArg<th>Edep in Pb
                        <th>Track length in lArg<th>Track length in Pb</tr>
  <tr align=center><td>1.5 mm <td>2.17 MeV+- 322 keV<td>13.06 MeV+- 949 keV
                   <td>8.37 mm+- 1.04 mm<td>8.02 mm+- 80 mum<br></tr>
  <tr align=center><td>0.15 mm<td>2.17 MeV+- 341 keV<td>13.15 MeV+- 940 keV
                   <td>8.83 mm+- 1.28 mm<td>8.67 mm+- 557 mum<br></tr>
</table>
<p>
Changing the threshold by a factor 10 lets the energy deposit unchanged
(as it must be: the energy loss is independant of DCUTE)<br>
and the charged track length variation within 1 percent.
(Remember that on the pictures 1000 events are surimposed)
