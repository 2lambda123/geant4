                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

June 1st, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-04)
- Added missing source file G4VProcessPlacer.cc previously resident in
  processes/transportation

June 1st, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-03)
- Renamed New classes back to normal classes, simultaneously 
  processes/transportation old biasing classes renamed with 
  suffix 8 to avoid clashes.
- includes modified G4GeometrySampler (without scoring)
- HEAD contains un-modifier G4GeometrySampler and depends on old scoring scheme
  in geometry/biasing.

May 31st, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-02)
- removed dependency on old biasing within transportation and on old scoring
  within geometry
- G4GeometrySampler is modified to remove scoring dependency
- HEAD of G4GeometrySampler is the old file
- HEAD contains a different version of G4GeometrySampler that includes the old
  biasing scoring for the purpose of testing

May 30th, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-01)
- added missing includes to GNUmakefile

May 30th, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-00)
- migrated classes and tests from processes/scoring

May 25th, 2007 Jane Tinslay
- Add tests for physics biasing under test/physics_biasing

March 21st, 2007  G.Cosmo
- Module and history file created.
