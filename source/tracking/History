                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

- correction of class description 

Nov 04, 00 T.Sasaki (tracking-V02-00-02)
- G4TrackingManager.icc has been modified for new biasing schme
- Descriptions are added too header files

Aug 30, 00 T.Sasaki (tracking-V02-00-01)
- Protection for no AtRestDoIt procs. 

June 2, 00 M.Asai (tracking-01-01-01)
- Add SetUserTrackInformation(G4VUserTrackInformation*) to
  G4TrackingManager
- Fix problems in deleteing Touchable in G4SteppingManager (Hisaya) 

Hune 1, 00 H.Kurashige
- Add "const" to all G4VTouchable pointer

Jan 23, 00 T.Sasaki 
- GetCurrentValue() in G4TrackingMessenger.cc have a return value
- SetUserAction in G4SteppingManager.hh protected null pointers

Oct 22, 99 T.Sasaki G4SteppingMangaer.cc fixed the UserLmit problem     

Oct 13, 99 T.Sasaki updated G4SteppingVerbose and G4VSteppingVerbose 

Jun 29, 99 G.Folger have the ctor always assign a SteppingVerbose to fVerbose

Apr 15, 99 M.Asai (tracking-01-00-03)
- Make arguments in user action classes take const pointers.
- Make trajectory and trajectory point as derivable classes.

Mar 23, 99 T.Sasaki    (tracking-01-00-02)
- Fix for precision problem of safety in SteppingManager by John Apostolakis
- G4VSteppingVerbose is introduced  

Feb 18, 99 T.Sasaki (tracking-01-00-01)
- ShowStep() method was moved from G4Step to G4SteppingVerbose

Nov 25, 98 T.Sasaki    (tracking-00-04-03)
- Fix to G4SteppingManager.cc to set proper 2ndary numbers.

Nov 17 ,98 H.Kurashige (tracking-00-04-01)
- Fixed treatment of safety in case of ApplyCuts flag is ON

August 25, 98 G.Cosmo (tracking-00-02-01)
- Minor fix to G4SteppingManager.hh, G4SteppingVerbose.hh
  and G4TrackVector.hh.
  Angle brackets should be used for inclusion of RW classes!

July  1, 98 K. Amako
- Tag for tracking-00-07-02. This includes the following features.
- Because J. Apostolakis changed  the way to calcluate safety in the 
  transportation AlongStepGPIL, the way to set safety of the PostStepPoint
  was modified. Except the first step, the safety of the PreStepPoint
  is also valid in this scheme.
- The coherent energy cut scheme is implemented. This means that 
  the energy of a secondary particle is checked against the energy
  cut value and also safety. Also the 'GoodForTracking' flag is 
  checked. A warning message will be issued if a secondary particle
  has illegal status (i.e. below energy cut and 'GoodForTracking' is off).
  Because processes don't set properly the 'GoodForTracking' yet, this
  waning message is temporary suppressed in the current tag.

June 22, 98 J.Apostolakis 

- Added fix to implementation of new scheme of 'Safety'.

June 16, 98 P.Urban                      -- recorded by J. Apostolakis

- Added changes for tracking optimisation.  (Merged from branch)
- tagged tracking-00-06-03.

June 11, 98 G.Cosmo (tracking-00-06-02)
- Tagged tracking-00-06-02.
  Includes changes by P.Mora de Freitas and M.Asai which were missing in
  the previous tag.

June 6, 98  M.Asai
- GNUmakefile is modified to correspond to the new "digits+hits" structure.

Jun  3, 98  P.Mora de Freitas/M.Verderi
- Implement new scheme of 'Safety' where it becomes the 'range within 
  the assumptions of all processes are valid'. In the G4SteppingManager
  GetPIL loop the safety becomes "competitive" like the step limitation. 
  This means that at the begining of every step the G4SteppingManager 
  will initialize it to DBLMAX and that processes can only decrease it.

May 22, 98  T.Sasaki
- Verbose codes are separated from SteppingManager. 2 files are aded.
April 21, 98 G.Cosmo (tracking-00-05-01)
- Tagged.

April 12, 98 H.Kuraashige
- Implement new scheme of 'Particle Change'. Please see 
  particle_change.asc in geant4alpha/documents/particles+matter/.
  G4SteppingManager.hh,  .cc have been modified.

April 9, 98 G.Cosmo
- Porting on DEC-cxx 6.0.
  Removed meaningless usage of "const" qualifier from functions
  return type for basic types by value. Modified files: G4Trajectory.hh

March 18, 1998 K. Amako
  Add following information to G4Track: 
     1.Momentum direction at the start point (vertex position) of the track 
     2.Kinetic energy at the start point (vertex position) of the track 
     3.Pointer to the process which created the current track 
  Due to this, the following files have modififed and committed.
     1.NewDesignDoc.txt 
     2.G4Track.hh, G4Track.cc 
     3.G4SteppingManager.cc 

January  29, 97 K. Amako
  Following changes have been done and committed/tagged to cvs.
  Tag# is tracking-00-03-01. 
    - G4SteppingManager.cc: Corrected so that the verbose 
      'AlongStepDoItAllDone' is invokded after the 'safety' update.
    - G4SteppingManager.cc: Added a comment in the 'G4Step Information' 
      table of the verbose output of 'AlongStepDoIt (process by process)' 
      so that 'safety' value in it is not updated yet.
    - G4TrackingMessanger.cc: Help for verbose has been updated.
  

December 19, 97 G. Cosmo - (alpha03)

- Created.
