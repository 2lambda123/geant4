This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

May,  3rd 2004 G.Cosmo
- G4SDManager, G4SDStructure: added optional argument 'warning' to
  FindSensitiveDetector(pathName, warning), defaulted to TRUE, to
  eventually exclude warning issued by G4SDManager when sensitive
  detector is not found.
  The fix has been requested by ALICE to deactivate the warning when
  a new sensitive-detector is created automatically in their framework.
