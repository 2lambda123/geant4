This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Jun 11, 2004, G.Cosmo (digits_hits-V06-01-03)
- Use global flag G4DIGI_ALLOC_EXPORT to export extern symbols for DLLs.
  Modified granular GNUmakefiles and rearranged usage of extern symbols
  in classes.

Jun 9, 2004, G.Cosmo (digits_hits-V06-01-02)
- Adopt G4DLLIMPORT/G4DLLEXPORT technique to handle extern simbols for
  allowing support of DLLs on Windows.
- Coworks with "global-V06-01-02b".

Jun 7, 2004, G.Cosmo (digits_hits-V06-01-01)
- G4THitsCollection, G4HCofThisEvent, G4TDigiCollection, G4DCofThisEvent:
  export extern symbols for allowing support of DLLs.
- GNUmakefile: added definition of GLOBLIBS for DLLs support on Windows.
- Coworks with "global-V06-01-02a".

May 3, 2004, G.Cosmo (digits_hits-V06-01-00)
- G4SDManager, G4SDStructure: added optional argument 'warning' to
  FindSensitiveDetector(pathName, warning), defaulted to TRUE, to
  eventually exclude warning issued by G4SDManager when sensitive
  detector is not found.
  The fix has been requested by ALICE to deactivate the warning when
  a new sensitive-detector is created automatically in their framework.
