                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

December 15,  1998 H.Kurashige (track-00-04-05)
- G4ParticleChange::CheckIt is activated in VERBOSE mode (Hisaya) 

December 12, 1998 H.Kurashige (track-00-04-04)
- Fixed bugs in G4Mars5GeVMechanism (Hisaya) 
- Added SwOnAllEB/SwOffAllEB in G4ParticleChange (Hisaya)

December 11, 1998 H.Kurashige (track-00-04-03)
- Fixed bugs in G4Mars5GeVMechanism (Hisaya)

December 9, 1998 L.Urban (track-00-04-02)
- Added G4ParticleChangeForLoss and G4ParticleChangeForMSC.

November 18, 98 H.Kurashige (track-00-04-01)A
- Added new member of weight in G4Track and removed G4BiasingTag
- Added Event Biasing based on MARS
- Modified argument type in G4Track  
  ( this tag requires particles-00-04-01 tag)

  (J.Apost.)

August 31, 98 G.Cosmo (track-00-02-01)

June 11, 98  J.Allison
- Added a missing inline keyword to G4Track.hh:341.

June 8, 98  H.Kurashige
- Add GoodForTracking and BelowThreshold flags in G4Track
  for new COHERENT scheme for the Cuts

May 12, 98 H.Kurashige
- Fix bugs in G4Step, G4ParticleChange
  Add new class of G4ParticleChangeForTransport

April 12, 98 H.Kuraashige
  Implement new scheme of 'Particle Change'. Please see 
  particle_change.asc in geant4alpha/documents/particles+matter/.
  Following files are modified (or added)
    G4ParticleChange.hh, .icc, .cc
    G4VParticleChange.hh, .icc, .cc
    G4ParticleChangeForDecay.hh, .cc
    G4Step.hh,  G4TrackFastVector.hh

April 9, 98 G.Cosmo
- Porting on DEC-cxx 6.0.
  Removed meaningless usage of "const" qualifier from functions
  return type for basic types by value. Modified files:
  G4ParticleChange.hh, .icc,
  G4Step.hh, G4StepPoint.hh, G4Track.hh

March 18, 1998 K. Amako
  Add following information to G4Track:
     1.Momentum direction at the start point (vertex position) of the track
     2.Kinetic energy at the start point (vertex position) of the track
     3.Pointer to the process which created the current track
  Due to this, the following files have modififed and committed.
     1.NewDesignDoc.txt
     2.G4Track.hh, G4Track.cc
     3.G4SteppingManager.cc


January  29, 97 K. Amako

December 19, 97 G. Cosmo - (alpha03)

- Created.
