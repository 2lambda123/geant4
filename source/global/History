February 08, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-00-03)
- STLInterface/cstring.icc: fixed yet another bug in G4String::toUpper()
  and G4String::toLower(). Loop over the string characters was causing
  bounds overflow.

January 31, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-00-02)
- STLInterface: several fixes.
  o Fixed bug in G4String::toUpper().
    (bug was introduced inadvertently on 20-Oct-1999).
  o Added checks for bound-overflows in G4RWTPtrSortedVector::find().
  o Fixed bound-check for operators () and [] in most collections:
    () access operators DO NOT perform bound-checking (except if G4DEBUG set);
    [] access operators DO perform bound-checking.
  o tpvector[.h.icc]: changed 'unsigned int' to 'size_t' in constructors.
    Added 'rwsize' and bound-checking for operator[].
  o tvvector.icc: added call to std_vector() in default constructor.
  o tpordvec.icc: added std_pvector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.
  o tvordvec.icc: added std_vector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.

January 19, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-00-01)
- G4UnitsTable[.hh.cc]: added constructor to G4BestUnit for 3vectors (M.Maire).
- globals.hh: added check on definition of CLHEP_MAX_MIN_DEFINED.

  vectors' classes (test comparison with previous tag).
- Reorganised cstring[.h.icc], no functional changes.

November 25, 99 G.Cosmo (global-V00-01-12)
- STLInterface: changes for ISO/ANSI C++ support:
  o Reorganised method definitions on wrapper classes; made templated
    vectors' methods all not inlined (test). Created .icc files accordingly.
  o Changed #define to typedef for std_string and protected in class
    scope. Introduced std_vector and std_pvector for collections,
    replaced G4std::vector<T> and G4std::vector<T*> accordingly.
- Added default comment header to files in STLInterface and class
  descriptions for Software Reference Manual.

November 23, 99 G.Cosmo (global-V00-01-11)

  of the HEAD. Namely: RWDEFAULT_CAPACITY, RWBoundsErr, RWGeneralException,
  RWTHROW, RW2STL_LessPtr and in some cases RWCString.

November 11, 99 G.Cosmo (global-V00-01-07)
- Migration RWT->G4RWT performed:

  tphdict and tvhdict to make them compliant with G4 coding standards and
  avoid clashes with external software in global scope.
- STLInterface: removed useless tests over size_t < 0 in files tvordvec.h,
  tvvector.h, tpsrtvec.h and tpordvec.h.

May 24, 99 G.Cosmo (global-01-00-04)
- globals.hh: removed inclusion of G4Timer.hh, left only G4Types.hh.
  The attempted solution does not work in situation where STL headers are pulled
  in before globals.hh. Several of this cases experienced on HP-aCC.
- STLInterface/rw/tphdict.h: added find() method to retrieve a key.

May 24, 99 G.Cosmo (global-01-00-03)
- G4Timer.hh: removed CPP cludge for the "times" clash in ObjectSpace.

  RW/STL headers. (F.Benher)
- Introduced G4Types.hh and replaced basic types definitions in globals.hh
  and G4Timer.hh.
- Added inclusion of G4Timer.hh in globals.hh to get rid of clashes about the
  order of inclusion. G4Timer.hh must appear -before- STL's <algorithm>.

  is STLInterface-04). Introduced wrapper files differentiated for each architecture.

May 11, 99 G.Cosmo
- Updates and fixes to STLInterface headers. Input mainly from DEC and HP.
- Added G4Poisson.hh to HEPRandom/include. It includes the implementation
  of the global function "G4long G4Poisson(G4double)" which reproduces the
  GPOISS algorithm adopted in Geant3. Uses the CLHEP standard engines as
  basic random generators.

May 3, 99 G.Cosmo (global-01-00-00)
- Updates to STL interface ISO/ANSI headers (F.Benher)
- Added G4Exception call with STL strings in globals.hh and G4Exception.cc (F.Benher)

April 29, 99 G.Cosmo

- Added first version of STL interface.

December 2, 98 M.Asai (global-00-04-02)
- Remove the construction of G4UnitsMessenger in G4UnitsTable. This messenger is
  constructed/destructed by G4UImanager to avoid a loop dependency.

  DEC cxx 5.X compiler not supported anymore.
- Moved G4ParticleTypes.hh to particles/management/include to remove
  dependency over particles category.

  categories. Dependency over intercoms to be fixed still.

December 1, 98 M.Nagamatu, H Yoshida
- G4ios.cc guarded by G4STREAM

November 27, 98 M.Asai
- G4UnitsMessenger has been moved to intercoms category to avoid a loop dependency.

November 12, 98 K. Amako (global-00-03-05)

- Initialized all data members of the base class in G4PhysicsOrderedFreeVector
  constructors.

November 6, 98 J.Allison (global-00-03-04)

- Fixed initialization of G4UnitDefinition::UnitsMessenger in
  G4UnitesTable.cc.

October 17, 98 H.Kurasige
- Modified G4FastVector.hh:
  new array is now created only if (items > N) in Initialize() method
  (in old version new array was created even when items are equal to N).

October 13, 98  M.Nagamatu (global-00-03-01)
- Added extern ostream G4cout/G4cerr under G4STREAM control.

October 13, 98 M.Maire

September 23, 98 G.Cosmo
- Replaced definition of min/max/sqr/abs with inclusion of
  CLHEP/config/TemplateFunctions.h. Now compliant with CLHEP-1.3.
- Replaced definition of G4UniformRand() with explicit call to the static
  engine of the generator. This obviates to a silly bug in the AIX compiler
  when treating static objects via -qtwolink option.

September 10, 98 G.Cosmo
- Added #undef min/max/sqr/abs to prevent possible macros definition
  (temporary solution to allow backward compatibility with CLHEP-1.2).
