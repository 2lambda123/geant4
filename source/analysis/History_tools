 1.2.0 : 28 May 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - waxml/ntuple : do not write the default option in the column element.
   It permits to have XML files with ntuple readable by jas3.
   The 1.4 release of ioda can also read these files.
 - sto : remove the "tellg() logic". There is a difference of comportement
   of tellg() in the g++ 4.6.x versions. We use now fail() to detect
   if a stream conversion toward numbers is ok or not.
 - tools/hbook/base_histo : have an hbook_id() method to get the... HBOOK ID!
 - tools/hbook/h1,h2,base_histo : displace scale() on base_histo.
 - tools/hbook/h1,h2,base_histo : add(),subtract(),multiply(),divide() methods.
   (To please Michel).
 - Slight corrections to remove messages from the -Wshadow "pinaillage" option.
   (Hell, if a compiler misunderstands the name of a local variable with the
   name of a method...)
 - Slight corrections to compile with clang++.
 - modify test/cpp/build to build the C++ programs from CYGWIN by using
   the Visual Studio compiler.

 1.1.0 : 8 Feb 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - split the fill_infos() function in wroot/infos.
   It was too long and induces warning with icc and g++.

 1.0.6 : 8 Feb 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - build from code of inexlib-1.3.
 - histo : some "this->" changed to "parent::".
   "this->" is needed only when invoking virtual methods.
 - have snpf to avoid too much #ifdef WIN32 for [v]snprintf.
 - have "typedef cid" in a standalone cid file.
 - remove some remaining inline keyword within class.
 - test/cpp/use_clang : to build with clang. Tested with
   clang-3.0 on MacOSX. To use clang :
     cd test/cpp
     ./build -clang
 - add this history file.
