 1.1.0 : 8 Feb 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - split the fill_infos() function in wroot/infos.
   It was too long and induces warning with icc and g++.

 1.0.6 : 8 Feb 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - build from code of inexlib-1.3.
 - histo : some "this->" changed to "parent::".
   "this->" is needed only when invoking virtual methods.
 - have snpf to avoid too much #ifdef WIN32 for [v]snprintf.
 - have "typedef cid" in a standalone cid file.
 - remove some remaining inline keyword within class.
 - test/cpp/use_clang : to build with clang. Tested with
   clang-3.0 on MacOSX. To use clang :
     cd test/cpp
     ./build -clang
 - add this history file.
