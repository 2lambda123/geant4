                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

24 May 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Added missing files in CLHEP built-in module.
  Allow for generation of DLL library on Windows for it.

11 May 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Including a subset of CLHEP classes imported from version CLHEP-2.1.0.1.
- Modifications applied vs. original CLHEP classes:
  * Removed dependency on internal CLHEP "defs.h" configuration header;
    the Geant4 built-in module for CLHEP follows the Geant4 build scheme.
  * Adopt "std" namespace for standard mathematical functions, where needed.
  * Removed dependency on ZM exceptions and replaced with "cerr" printouts
    where necessary.
  * Renamed following files for coherency and standard:
    o Inlined code *.src to *.icc and moved to includes set;
    o DualConv.hh to DualConv.h.
  * Use coherent inclusion scheme also for internal headers/data/inline-code,
    where applicable.
  * Use of standard WIN32 compiler flag where applicable.
  * Cleared source code of de-activated debug blocks and minor cleanup,
    where applicable.
  * Rename of final CLHEP library produced, from 'CLHEP' to 'g4clhep'.
