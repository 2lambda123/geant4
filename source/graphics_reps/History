This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

greps-01-00-05  12th May 1999  John Allison
- Made destructors virtual where applicable.

greps-01-00-04  28th April 1999  John Allison

  fDaughtersInvisible.

greps-00-04-02 02 December 1998 Evgeni Tcherniaev

point lying on the nurbs surface.

greps-00-04-01  25th November 1998  John Allison

greps-00-03-03  9th November 1998 Satoshi Tanaka
Added G4String fInfo and its access functions to G4VMarker

greps-00-03-02  6th November 1998  John Allison
- Cleaned up GNUmakefile - no longer includes unnecesary -I's

greps-00-03-01  26th September 1998  John Allison

greps-00-02-03  21st August 1998  John Allison
- Rationalised G4VisExtent::G4VisExtent (const G4Point3D& centre,
  G4double radius) so that iit is a true "inverse" of GetExtentRadius.
- Added global target to GNUmakefile (Gabriele Cosmo).

greps-00-02-02  14th August 1998  John Allison
- Added GeometryHasChanged() to G4VVisManager.  To be used by the run manager.

greps-00-02-01  6th August 1998  John Allison

greps-00-06-03  26th June 1998  Gabriele Cosmo

1st June 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Added Draw(), ClearView(), Show() to G4VVisManager.

greps-00-06-01  29th April 1998  John Allison
- Introduced Establish/DecommissionSpecials (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&)
  in place of BeginModeling (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&).

April 21st, 98 G.Cosmo (greps-00-05-03)
- Tagged.

April 9th, 98 G.Cosmo
- Porting on DEC-cxx 6.0.
  Removed meaningless usage of "const" qualifier from functions
  return type for basic types by value. Modified files: G4NURBS.cc

greps-00-05-02  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Re-engineered maintenance of current depth, etc.  Needed new method
  G4VGraphicsScene::BeginModeling (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  graphics_reps.  The result is much cleaner model and modeling
  parameters classes.  Also, the current depth, physical volume and
  logical volume are immediately available as protected pointers in
  G4VScene.

HEAD  3rd April 1998  John Allison
- Added GetWorld/ScreenDiameter/Radius to G4VMarker.

April 2, 1998 G.Barrand :
