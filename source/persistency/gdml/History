                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

25 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Bugs fixed in the writer (G4GMLWriteStructure::physvolWrite):
>> The signs of the rotational angles were incorrect in certain cases (180 degree,90 degree,...)
>> The reflection was incorrect in case of reflecting a subtree 
- Now the package is capable of reading and writing back the LHCb geometry correctly.

23 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Composite materials added to writer
- Cone added to writer
- Tube added to writer
- Boolean solid (intersection,subtraction,union) added to writer

22 January 2008 Z.Torzsok

- Extruded solid is added to writer

- "Reading multiple GDML files and writing out into a single GDML file" - optimized.
  >> The mother volume is moved to the end of the list after its daugthers are processed...
  >> ... only when necessary, when new logical volumes come from the daughters!

- Reflected solid is removed from the written GDML files. Scale transformation is used instead.

21 Januray 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Reflected solid is added to writer
- "Reading multiple GDML files and writing out into a single GDML file" - problem solved.
  
  >> If I instantiate a logical volume (let's say the mother volume), it will be added to the end of list of volumes (G4LogicalVolumeStore).
  >> Once this logical volume is instantiated we can add daughters
  >> If a daughter refers to an external file, additional logical volumes will come
  >> These logical volumes will be added to the list as well, AFTER the mother volume
  >> In the mother volume these logical volumes can be referenced...
  >> ...but these logical volumes are not instantiated yet when we instantiate the mother!
  >> That's why we move the mother volume at the end of the list after the daughters are processed.

- The class hierarchy of the GDML parser/writer is finished:

Write <- WriteDefine <-WriteMaterials <- WriteSolids <- WriteSetup <-               WriteStructure  \
                                                                                                     | => Parser
Read  <- ReadDefine  <- ReadMaterials <- ReadSolids  <- ReadSetup <- ReadParamvol <- ReadStructure  /

16 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Starting the materials section

15 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Writer implements the setup section too

11 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Reader is now capable of resolving entities

08 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Vertex referencing is fixed in tessellated solid 
  (using the identifier "vertex" according to the schema)

07 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Starting to implement the writer

30 November, 07  Z.Torzsok (gdml-V09-00-04)
- Fine tuning of the class hierarchy and fixed issue with reflections.

23 November, 07  Z.Torzsok (gdml-V09-00-03)
- Better handling of embedded loops and first adaptation.

22 November, 07  Z.Torzsok (gdml-V09-00-02)
- Handling of embedded loops added.
- Fixed compilation problems on Windows platform.

19 November, 07  G.Cosmo (gdml-V09-00-01)
- Better handling of modular GDML files and reflections (Z.Torzsok).
- Added disclaimer to all files. Use G4 types.
- Fixed compilation problems on SUN platform.

15 November, 07  Z.Torzsok (gdml-V09-00-00)
- Added support for modular files.
- Completed set of specific solids. Supported reflections and divisions.

02 November, 07  G.Cosmo (persistency-V09-00-00)
- Added G4LIB_BUILD_GDML/G4LIB_USE_GDML flags to trigger compilation through
  the central scripts. Moved setup for XERCESC (includes and libs paths) to
  central scripts.
- Coworks with tag "config-V09-00-06".

17 October, 07  Z.Torzsok
- Introduced new "gdml" plugin sub-module, based on new GDML release 3.
