                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

     ----------------------------------------------------------

Jun 11th, 2004 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V06-01-01)
------------------------
- Added check to G4Navigator to count the number of steps with zero length
  and issue an exception for tracks that get stuck in a loop (J.Apostolakis).
- Modified GNUmakefile to define G4GEOMETRY_ALLOC_EXPORT flag for DLLs
  build on Windows.

May 17th, 2004 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V06-01-00)
------------------------
- Added more verbosity on solids response for navigators (optimised/not
  optimised) if "check_mode" state is combined with verbose level-1.

Mar 11th, 2004 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V06-00-02)
------------------------
- Added "check_mode" state for navigators. The state can be activated by
  a new UI command (geometry/navigator/check_mode [true/false]) and will
  force more strict and less tolerant checks in step/safety computation to
  verify the correctness of solids' response in the geometry.
- Reorganised verbosity levels. Added more useful information activated
  when in G4VERBOSE mode and verbosity level selected.
  Fixed output formatting when entering/exiting verbose blocks.

Feb 27th, 2004 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V06-00-01)
------------------------
- G4Navigator.cc:
  o Fixed old outstanding bug in ComputeStep() for the location of the
    the local point in the calculation of a valid exit normal. (V.Grichine)

Feb  9th, 2004 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V06-00-00)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc:
  o ReEstimateEndpoint:  Changed to cope with a failure of AccurateAdvance,
                         by calling it iteratively up maximum 20 times.
  o SetVerboseLevel, now forwards the verbosity (minus 3) to integration driver

Dec 11th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-15)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc:
  o LocateIntersectionPoint: Refined re-setting of finalSection.
    --> Endpoint recalculation is returned only for final section.
    (trial fix in -14 is replaced by above code)
  o Fixed ReEstimateEndPoint which ignored return code of AccurateAdvance
    and moved to short end-point for long requests
    It now leaves the endpoint unchanged, when it cannot improve it.
  o Few format changes for PrintStatus

Dec 10th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-14)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc on top of latest (not 1.7):
  o Fix for the case where two previous corrections are 'operational'
     Problem if the current endpoint is not the final one, and it has been
     recalculated, and we need to go beyond the current section to the
     final one -- the recalcuted endpoint no longer valid!

Dec 10th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-13)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc:
  o Gone back to version 1.7, without the fix in LocateIntersectionPoint 
      for the "long-standing error".

Dec  5th, 2003 - G.Cosmo - (geomnav-V05-02-12)
------------------------
- G4TransportationManager.cc:
  o removed initialisation of allocators for navigation levels, where they
    were introduced as workaround for solving static initialisation a long
    time ago. Now moved to "volumes" module, where they should belong, in
    G4TouchableHistory.cc.
- Restored original unit-tests, using inherited navigator.
  --> Requires geomvol-V05-02-08
 
Dec  4th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-11)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc 
  o Corrected placement of #endif for two #ifdef VERBOSE

Dec  2nd, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-10)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.cc]:
   o Fixed LocateIntersectionPoint for long-standing error.
     A section of the chord was not considered in use case where
     a previous chord at first appeared to have an intersection, but did not.

Nov 26th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-09)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.cc]:
  o Added argument Method LocateIntersectionPoint G4bool& recalculatedEndPt
    to return 'true' if the endpoint has been recalculated.
    This fixes a problem that can occasionally cause the skipping of a volume 
    boundary - in the case when a re-integration was done near a boundary,
    because the new endpoint was previously not passed back.
  o ComputeStep also changed to accept above recalculation.
  o New method GetVerboseLevel(),  closer to std naming than Verbose()

Nov 14th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-08)
------------------------------
- Retagged the files of tag "geomnav-V05-02-07", due to tagging with same
  name incorrectly files in another directory and, as such confusing Bonsai.

Nov 13th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-07)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Pass safety sphere information to G4ChordFinder for optimisation
  o Including G4ChordFinder.hh only in .cc file
- Requires and coworks with "field-V05-02-08" tag. 


Nov 10th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-06)
------------------------
- G4Navigator[.hh.icc.cc] - methods review:
  o Removed obsolete methods: IsExitNormalValid(), GetLocalExitNormal().
  o Renamed method LocateGlobalPointAndSetup(p,v,history) to
    ResetHistoryAndLocate(p,v,history).
  o Moved to protected the following methods: GetCurrentLocalCoordinate(),
    ComputeLocalPoint(), ComputeLocalAxis(), NetTranslation(),
    NetRotation(), EnteredDaughterVolume().
  o Fixed consistency of inline/not-inline implementations of methods.
- Coworks with tag "tracking-V05-02-03".

Nov 6th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-05)
-----------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Implements move of EpsilonMin / Max to G4FieldManager.
- Requires and coworks with "field-V05-02-04" or later tag.

Nov 6th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-04)
-----------------------
- G4Navigator[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Made relevant methods virtual to verify performance impact.
    If tests will behave reasonably, a further refinement in the
    design of the class will be applied, in view of a more consistent
    design review next year.

Nov 3rd, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-03)
-----------------------
- Code cleanup and headers inclusion review
  (replaced by forward declarations where necessary).
- Added build system to tests. Cleared compilation warnings.

Oct 29th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-02)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField: 
  Added option to turn On/Off the optimisation of using the safety 
  in calling G4Navigator. 
- Unit tests: moved test testG4NavigatorX, X=1,2,3,4,5,6 here from
  "volumes" module.

Oct 24th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-01)
------------------------
- Migrated calls to G4Exception to new scheme.
- Fixed compilation warning in G4PropagationInField.
