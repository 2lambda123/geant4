                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

     ----------------------------------------------------------

Dec  5th, 2003 - G.Cosmo - (geomnav-V05-02-12)
------------------------
- G4TransportationManager.cc:
  o removed initialisation of allocators for navigation levels, where they
    were introduced as workaround for solving static initialisation a long
    time ago. Now moved to "volumes" module, where they should belong, in
    G4TouchableHistory.cc.
- Restored original unit-tests, using inherited navigator.

Dec  4th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-11)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc:
  o Corrected placement of #endif for an #ifdef VERBOSE.

Dec  2nd, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-10)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.cc]:
   o Fixed LocateIntersectionPoint for long-standing error.
     A section of the chord was not considered in use case where
     a previous chord at first appeared to have an intersection, but did not.

Nov 26th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-09)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.cc]:
  o Added argument Method LocateIntersectionPoint G4bool& recalculatedEndPt
    to return 'true' if the endpoint has been recalculated.
    This fixes a problem that can occasionally cause the skipping of a volume 
    boundary - in the case when a re-integration was done near a boundary,
    because the new endpoint was previously not passed back.
  o ComputeStep also changed to accept above recalculation.
  o New method GetVerboseLevel(),  closer to std naming than Verbose()

Nov 14th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-08)
------------------------------
- Retagged the files of tag "geomnav-V05-02-07", due to tagging with same
  name incorrectly files in another directory and, as such confusing Bonsai.

Nov 13th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-07)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Pass safety sphere information to G4ChordFinder for optimisation
  o Including G4ChordFinder.hh only in .cc file
- Requires and coworks with "field-V05-02-08" tag. 


Nov 10th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-06)
------------------------
- G4Navigator[.hh.icc.cc] - methods review:
  o Removed obsolete methods: IsExitNormalValid(), GetLocalExitNormal().
  o Renamed method LocateGlobalPointAndSetup(p,v,history) to
    ResetHistoryAndLocate(p,v,history).
  o Moved to protected the following methods: GetCurrentLocalCoordinate(),
    ComputeLocalPoint(), ComputeLocalAxis(), NetTranslation(),
    NetRotation(), EnteredDaughterVolume().
  o Fixed consistency of inline/not-inline implementations of methods.
- Coworks with tag "tracking-V05-02-03".

Nov 6th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-05)
-----------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Implements move of EpsilonMin / Max to G4FieldManager.
- Requires and coworks with "field-V05-02-04" or later tag.

Nov 6th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-04)
-----------------------
- G4Navigator[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Made relevant methods virtual to verify performance impact.
    If tests will behave reasonably, a further refinement in the
    design of the class will be applied, in view of a more consistent
    design review next year.

Nov 3rd, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-03)
-----------------------
- Code cleanup and headers inclusion review
  (replaced by forward declarations where necessary).
- Added build system to tests. Cleared compilation warnings.

Oct 29th, 2003 - J.Apostolakis  (geomnav-V05-02-02)
------------------------------
- G4PropagatorInField: 
  Added option to turn On/Off the optimisation of using the safety 
  in calling G4Navigator. 
- Unit tests: moved test testG4NavigatorX, X=1,2,3,4,5,6 here from
  "volumes" module.

Oct 24th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-01)
------------------------
- Migrated calls to G4Exception to new scheme.
- Fixed compilation warning in G4PropagationInField.

Sep 29th, 2003 - G.Cosmo  (geomnav-V05-02-00)
------------------------
- Created.
  Imported classes from "volumes", "management" and "verification" modules:
    G4AuxiliaryNavServices[.hh.icc]		- from geometry/volumes
    G4GeometryMessenger[.hh.cc]			-	"	"
    G4Navigator[.hh.icc.cc]			-	"	"
    G4NormalNavigation[.hh.icc.cc]		-	"	"
    G4ParameterisedNavigation[.hh.icc.cc]	-	"	"

    G4ReplicaNavigation[.hh.icc.cc]		-	"	"
    G4TransportationManager[.hh.icc.cc]		-	"	"
    G4VoxelNavigation[.hh.icc.cc]		-	"	"
    G4DrawVoxels[.hh.cc]			- from geometry/management
    G4GeomTest*[.hh.cc]				- from geometry/verification
- Cleared call to PV->Setup() according to changes in G4VPhysicalVolume.
  Affected files: G4Navigator[.icc.cc], G4ParameterisedNavigation[.icc.cc],
                  G4VoxelNavigation[.icc.cc], G4ReplicaNavigation[.icc.cc],
                  G4NormalNavigation[.icc.cc].
- G4DrawVoxels: retrieve top transformation through touchable history in
  method DrawVoxels(). Removed old method GetAbsoluteTransformation().
- G4GeomTestErrorList.cc: retrieve top transformation through touchable
  history in method FindGlobalCoordinateSystem().

- G4GeomTestVolume[.hh.cc]:
  o Added methods TestRecursiveLine() and TestRecursiveCylinder() for
    allowing recursion on line_test and cylinder_test respectively.
  o Introduced ability to control depth and starting level of recursion.

Jul 30th, 2002          G.Cosmo  (geomver-V04-01-00)
