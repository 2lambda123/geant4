// Class description:
//
// G4AssemblyVolume is a helper class to make the build process of geometry
// easier. It allows to combine several volumes together in an arbitrary way
// in 3D space and then work with the result as with a single logical volume
// for placement.
// The resulting objects are independent copies of each of the assembled
// logical volumes. The placements are not, however, bound one to each other
// when placement is done. They are seen as independent physical volumes in
// space. This is the main difference when compared to the boolean solids or
// parametrised physical volumes.
