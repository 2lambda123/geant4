- G4LogicalVolume.cc:
  o Correction to propagation of the Field Manager to Daughter volumes:
    it should be propagated to all daughters that do not have one -- not to all the
    ones that have one already. Fixes bug report for field by logical volume.
    (J.Apostolakis)

October 28, 2002  G. Cosmo                 geommng-V04-01-03

- G4PVParameterised.cc:
  o Improved output diagnostics for check on illegal constructions.

October 16, 2002  G. Cosmo                 geommng-V04-01-01

  of daughter volumes for replicas and parameterised volumes, as well as checks
  for attempt to replicate/parameterise the world volume.

October 4, 2002  G. Cosmo
- G4PVParameterised[.hh.cc], G4PVPlacement[.hh.cc]:
  Added new method IsParameterised() to enquire for existing parameterisation
  for a placed volume.

- G4AssemblyVolume[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Fixed bug #409 concerning missing imprint counter method.
  o Fixed bug #410 concerning the internal counting mechanism.
    The fix involved the addition of a new data member fAssemblyID,
    holding the instance ID of the given object derived from
    class-wide counter. Corresponding accessor methods has been
    added as well.
- Updated unit test TestAssemblyVolume, to add call to G4RunManager
  for resetting nagivator state in TstVADetectorConstruction.cc.

June 24, 2002  G. Cosmo                    geommng-V04-00-08

    with corresponding deallocation at destruction time.
    Comments updated accordingly with a warning about foreseen changes
    in methods' interfaces expected by next major release 5.0.
  o Correctly handle cases when pointer to rotation matrix is zero.
  o Updated unit test.

May 17, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-06
- Added ability to optionally optimise/non-optimise detector regions
  using logical volumes:
  o G4LogicalVolume:
    - Introduced additional bool argument to constructor,
      set to 'true' by default.
    - Added method IsToOptimise() with corresponding bool flag attribute.
  o G4GeometryManager:
    - Adapted BuildOptimisations() method to consider optional optimisation
      flag from G4LogicalVolume.

May 15, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-05
- G4SmartVoxelHeader:
  o Added utility method GetParamAxis() to retrieve suggested axis for
    optimisation of parametrised geometry.
  o Enhanced BuildReplicaVoxels() to apply 3D voxelisation for non-consuming
    nodes if undefined axis is specified for parametrised volumes. In such
    case, optimisation for parameterised volumes is applied similarly to
    normal placements.
- G4PVReplica.cc: deal with 'kUndefined' EAxis.
- Co-works with "global-V04-00-06".

May 13, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-04
- G4VSolid: use polygon clipping for limited voxel when != pAxis (V.Grichine).
- G4GeometryManager: added method IsGeometryClosed() for detecting geometry
  closed or open.
- G4LogicalVolumeStore, G4PhysicalVolumeStore, G4SolidStore: added protection
  to Clean() method for checking if geometry is closed.
- G4SmartVoxelHeader.cc: cosmetics and formatting cleanup.

April 19, 2002  G. Cosmo                   geommng-V04-00-03

  Affected files: G4DrawVoxels[.hh.cc], G4SmartVoxelNode[.hh.cc],
                  G4SmartVoxelProxy[.hh.cc], G4VoxelLimits[.hh.cc].
- Enhanced behavior for destructors of volumes/solids stores.
  o Added locking mechanism for preventing conflicts when destroying stores
    and deregistering pointers. Now destructors of stores will also
    explicitely delete pointers (and therefore allocated volumes/solids)
    dynamically allocated in the user application.
  o Added Clean() static method to volumes/solids stores to explicitely
    delete pointed objects in the stores and clear all entries.
  o Modified files: G4LogicalVolumeStore[.hh.cc], G4SolidStore[.hh.cc],
                    G4PhysicalVolumeStore[.hh.cc].

April 16, 2002  V. Grichine                geommng-V04-00-02

  slice_no < no_slices.

November 30, 1999  G. Cosmo                geommng-V00-01-01a
- G4DrawVoxels.cc:
  Fixed initialization of (const G4VPhysicalVolume*) in method
  GetAbsoluteTransformation(). Fix needed for NT/VC++ compiler.

November 09, 1999  J. Apostolakis          geommng-V00-01-01
- G4VPhysicalVolume:
   i) Made G4RotationMatrix G4VPhysicalVolume::GetObjectRotation() const
      non-inline and moved it to source file from inline file.
  ii) Added GetObjectRotationValue() method.
 iii) Minimal changes of comments for Software Ref. Manual in header file

  [ Change i) caused problem with HP aCC compiler A.01.19.  Atlas 
     was patching the code to try to get around this, but this 
     resolution is much better ]

  This problem was seen in ATLAS code.
