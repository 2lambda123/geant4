                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

  (by R.Chytracek).

February 07, 2001  G. Cosmo                geommng-V03-00-00
- Introduced first implementation of G4AssemblyVolume, a helper class to
  combine several volumes together in an arbitrary way in the 3D space.
  Added files: G4AssemblyVolume[.hh.icc.cc], G4AssemblyTriplet[.hh.icc]
  (by R.Chytracek).
- Added unit test suite for G4AssemblyVolume class: TestAssemblyVolume
  (by R.Chytracek).

- Minor fix to private assignment operator.

November 20, 2000  G. Cosmo                geommng-V02-00-04
- Fixes to remove warnings from "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" g++ compiler options:
  o commented out variables declared and not used.
  o fixed declaration of variables used before being initialised.
  o fixed order of initialisation of member data in constructors.
  o fixed usage of unsigned-int (size_t) for array indeces.

November 16, 2000  V.Grichine              geommng-V02-00-03
- Fix in G4VSolid::CalculateClippedPoligonExtent(): removed assumption
  that pMin<pMax by eliminating "else" condition. (D.Williams)

November 9, 2000   G.Cosmo                 geommng-V02-00-02

  o Added (private) declarations of copy constructor and assignment
    operator where needed.
  o Added "const" qualifier to accessor methods, wherever needed.
  o Added equality check on operator= where needed.
  o Made destructor "virtual" for classes having virtual methods,
    wherever missing.
  o Changed virtual functions to non-inline wherever's the case.
  o Added "inline" qualifier to methods' declarations.
  o Replaced usage of "do-loops" with "while-loops" in
    G4VoxelLimits::ClipToLimits().

June 06, 2000   G.Cosmo                    geommng-V01-01-00

- G4DrawVoxels.hh: removed line '#define G4DrawVoxelsDebug' left in place
  accidentally in the code...

April 20, 2000   G. Cosmo

- Reorganised comments for the Software Reference Manual.
- Moved inlined definition to .icc files, where needed.
  Created: G4SmartVoxelHeader.icc, G4SmartVoxelNode.icc,
           G4SmartVoxelProxy.icc, G4VoxelLimits.icc.

April 11, 2000   J. Allison

- Made virtual G4VisExtent G4VSolid::GetExtent() non-pure and implemented
    a default in terms of CalculateExtent.

January 19, 00       G. Cosmo              geommng-V01-00-00

Syncronized file versioning with HEAD (several CVS headers changed
due to the recent migration for ISO C++)

January 19, 00       J. Allison

G4DrawVoxels.cc:

Assured GetSlice(slice_no) is called for slice_no < no_slices.

November 30, 99      G. Cosmo              geommng-V00-01-01a

G4DrawVoxels.cc:

Fixed initialization of (const G4VPhysicalVolume*) in method
GetAbsoluteTransformation(). Fix needed for NT/VC++ compiler.

November 09, 99      J. Apostolakis        geommng-V00-01-01

G4VPhysicalVolume:
  i) Made G4RotationMatrix G4VPhysicalVolume::GetObjectRotation() const
      non-inline and moved it to source file from inline file.
 ii) Added GetObjectRotationValue() method.
iii) Minimal changes of comments for Software Ref. Manual in header file

  [ Change i) caused problem with HP aCC compiler A.01.19.  Atlas 
     was patching the code to try to get around this, but this 
     resolution is much better ] 

March    17, 99      J. Apostolakis        geommng-01-00-02

G4AffineTransform.icc:  
 
  Corrected a typo in InverseProduct (rzy->ryz) that caused the incorrect 
calculation of a compound transformation (if tf1.tz*tf2.ryz != 0). 

  [ This problem was seen in the code of two Atlas Geant4 collaborators:
     Andrea del' Acqua and Maya Stavrinakou ]
