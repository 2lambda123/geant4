                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

February 17th, 1998   J. Apostolakis -  field-01-00-02

 Moved G4PropagatorInField files to geometry/volumes. 
 Updated GNUmakefile not to depend on geometry/volumes anymore.
   -> the known circular dependency is removed


February 12th, 1998   J. Apostolakis -  field-spin1-works1     (act Feb17)

  A tag that contains the first version that worked with spin (in Peter G.'s
directory).   G4PropagateInSpin is still in this version.  A small change
in a branch of the header file was needed. 


February 10th, 1998   J. Apostolakis 

All the following changes are needed for energy integration also:

G4ChordFinder now passes to the constructed driver the number of variables.
Because of the need for the stepper to know about it in its Abstract interface

-> Moved theNumberOfVariables  from derived class G4MagErrorStepper
                               to base class G4MagIntegratorStepper

As a consequense the classes that derived from G4MagIntegratorStepper directly
were changed: G4CashKarpRKF45, G4MagHelicalStepper, 


February  9th, 1998    J. Apostolakis

Equation of Motion:
G4MagEqRhs.hh  Made SetChargeMomentumMass virtual, so that G4Mag_SpinEqRhs
                 can initialise its constants too. 


February  9th, 1998   P. Gumplinger

Added Equation of Motion for Spin in Magnetic Field.


February 17th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-01-00-01
  --->  date is correct, made sure that tag does not include above fixes!
  
 Moved G4PropagatorInField files to geometry/volumes. 
 Updated GNUmakefile not to depend on geometry/volumes anymore.
   -> the known circular dependency is removed


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ------    Geant 4  Production Release   ------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-04-01head ===> R+D version only

 G4PropagatorInField files modified:

   - to store the last safety computed and its origin.
   - to give them to a requester
------------------------------------------------------------------

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-03b

 Subtle fix to interface of G4UniformMagField::GetFieldValue  
         ( that tripped Visual C++ )

 G4PropagatorInField:  added printing method for verboseness.

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-03a

   Steppers:  Fixed instance variables construction (SimpleRunge)
              and clash of names in CashKarp::StepWithEstimate

   Added post-const to all Field classes for
           void GetFieldValue(const G4double yTrack[] ,
                                 G4double B[]      ) const ;

   Added SetFieldValue methods to UniformMagField

   Added GetConstantFieldValue() methods to Uniform Mag & Electric Fields


Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-03

   Fixes to Propagate and Steppers

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-02

   Minor corrections  (???)

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-02
 
   Major development to allow Electric Field
   


June  17th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  magfield-06-03

 Modified Files:
        include/G4PropagatorInField.hh
            src/G4PropagatorInField.cc
           test/testPropagateInField.cc
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1)  Added an assertion after each call to LocateGlobalPointAndSetup. 
     It checks that the located volume is equal to the current volume.
     If this check fails, the Propagator does not know how to continue.

 2)  Added an argument  to ComputeStep method of G4PropagatorInField.
  The new volume argument is used to check the current volume during the step.

 3)  When G4Navigator's ComputeStep returned  stepLength==stepRequested,  this
used to be treated as a failure to intersect.  This is incorrect.

    stepLength==stepRequested is an intersection,
      so I am now treating it as such in each comparison (of 3).
      Ignoring it causes problems, including volume being skipped.
      --> but treating it as an intersection used to cause problems too ??


May    7th, 1998    J. Apostolakis  -  magfield-06-02-helix01

- Tag includes new version of G4ChordFinder (not used by W.Wander).


May    7th, 1998    W. Wander     (recorded/commited by  J. Apostolakis)

- New "helical" RK steppers that move in helical segments, not linear.
    * Several changes to add steppers 

 Modified Files:
        G4MagErrorStepper.hh 
        G4MagErrorStepper.cc 
           added Helical stepping methods to this general ABC.
        
        G4MagIntegratorStepper.hh
           made RightHandSide virtual   (this will be reversed very soon)

        testPropagateMagField.cc
           Test of Helical stepping functionality added.
           
 Added Files for new Helical RK steppers, deriving from G4MagErrorStepper:
        G4HelixExplicitEuler.cc  ( and .hh )
        G4HelixHeum.cc
        G4HelixImplicitEuler.cc
        G4HelixSimpleRunge.cc  

 Added File for implementation:
        G4MagErrorStepper.icc


May    7th, 1998    J. Apostolakis   -  magfield-06-01

- added small changes to 
    * G4ChordFinder:           methods to get/set IntegratorDriver
    * G4MagIntegratorDriver:   made OneGoodStep method public
- created the file.
