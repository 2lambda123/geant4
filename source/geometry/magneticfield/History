                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-04-01head

 G4PropagatorInField files modified:

   - to store the last safety computed and its origin.
   - to give them to a requester

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-03b

 Subtle fix to interface of G4UniformMagField::GetFieldValue  
         ( that tripped Visual C++ )

 G4PropagatorInField:  added printing method for verboseness.

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-03a

   Steppers:  Fixed instance variables construction (SimpleRunge)
              and clash of names in CashKarp::StepWithEstimate

   Added post-const to all Field classes for
           void GetFieldValue(const G4double yTrack[] ,
                                 G4double B[]      ) const ;

   Added SetFieldValue methods to UniformMagField

   Added GetConstantFieldValue() methods to Uniform Mag & Electric Fields


Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-03

   Fixes to Propagate and Steppers

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-02

   Minor corrections  (???)

Nov   19th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  field-00-03-02
 
   Major development to allow Electric Field
   


June  17th, 1998   J. Apostolakis  -  magfield-06-03

 Modified Files:
        include/G4PropagatorInField.hh
            src/G4PropagatorInField.cc
           test/testPropagateInField.cc
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1)  Added an assertion after each call to LocateGlobalPointAndSetup. 
     It checks that the located volume is equal to the current volume.
     If this check fails, the Propagator does not know how to continue.

 2)  Added an argument  to ComputeStep method of G4PropagatorInField.
  The new volume argument is used to check the current volume during the step.

 3)  When G4Navigator's ComputeStep returned  stepLength==stepRequested,  this
used to be treated as a failure to intersect.  This is incorrect.

    stepLength==stepRequested is an intersection,
      so I am now treating it as such in each comparison (of 3).
      Ignoring it causes problems, including volume being skipped.
      --> but treating it as an intersection used to cause problems too ??


May    7th, 1998    J. Apostolakis  -  magfield-06-02-helix01

- Tag includes new version of G4ChordFinder (not used by W.Wander).


May    7th, 1998    W. Wander     (recorded/commited by  J. Apostolakis)

- New "helical" RK steppers that move in helical segments, not linear.
    * Several changes to add steppers 

 Modified Files:
        G4MagErrorStepper.hh 
        G4MagErrorStepper.cc 
           added Helical stepping methods to this general ABC.
        
        G4MagIntegratorStepper.hh
           made RightHandSide virtual   (this will be reversed very soon)

        testPropagateMagField.cc
           Test of Helical stepping functionality added.
           
 Added Files for new Helical RK steppers, deriving from G4MagErrorStepper:
        G4HelixExplicitEuler.cc  ( and .hh )
        G4HelixHeum.cc
        G4HelixImplicitEuler.cc
        G4HelixSimpleRunge.cc  

 Added File for implementation:
        G4MagErrorStepper.icc


May    7th, 1998    J. Apostolakis   -  magfield-06-01

- added small changes to 
    * G4ChordFinder:           methods to get/set IntegratorDriver
    * G4MagIntegratorDriver:   made OneGoodStep method public
- created the file.
