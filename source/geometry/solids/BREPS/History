History file for geometry/solids/BREPS







November 11, 1998 : L. Broglia

 - correct Inside function for G4SphericalSurface
 - create (but now is empty) Inside function for
   G4CylindricalSurface
 - new implementation into G4CylindricalSurface::Intersect


November 04, 1998  L. Broglia    geometry-00-03-04

- Cleaned up trivial errors on DEC (undefined loop variables).
- Removed old CurveTest, now separate in G4BREPSolidxxxTest files
- Changing the name of the output files. All the tests run correctly with
  Linux, Sun, HP and DEC compilers

Changed

<           HitDistance = closest_point.distance2(RayStart);

to
>           HitDistance = closest_point.distance2((G4Point3D &)RayStart);

   because
              distance2( HepPoint3D &p )
   in CLHEP/Point3D
   should be
              distance2( const HepPoint3D &p )
   as it is const!


October 29, 1998  L. Broglia

 - Changed all the occurences of G4Placement into G4Axis2Placement3D.
 - Modified G4FPlane - new implementation, inheriting from G4Axis2Placement3D
 - Create in G4PointRat INFINITY which is a double and PINFINITY which is a 
   HepVector3D
 - Corrected a bug into G4BREPSolidCylinder
 - Created  a test for the curves
 - Created tests for all BREP solids.
   For the moment, only test for the sphere and test for the torus 
   run correctly
 - Created a test which read a STEP file and created the BREP solid




October 20, 1998  L. Broglia    Breps-lionel-tag1-point3D

- Changed all the occurences of G4Point3d, G4Point2d into G4Point3D, which 
  is a HepPoint3D.
- Modified G4PointRat - new implementation, inheriting from G4Point3D.
- Changed ThreeVec into Vector3D or Point3D, depending on its use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

October 13, 1998  J. Apostolakis  geometry-00-03-01

- Tag created.

October 12, 1998  J. Apostolakis  geometry-00-03-01

- Small (cosmetic) changes to aid in compilation on Sun, HP.  
   Renamed local variables, whose name was the same as a class variable or method.

July   9, 1998: J. Apostolakis  breps-00-01-02

- Fixes to G4Assembly, to aid STEPinterface.  (Jari).
- Fix to G4Placement equality operator.   (J.A.)
  Compiles on AIX.


July   8, 1998: J. Apostolakis  breps-00-01-01

- Tagged. 


July   5, 1998: P. Urban

  - Fixes to compile on AIX-AFS.


July   2, 1998: J. Apostolakis (for P. Urban)

- All of Peter Urban's development of Curves is added from 
  the head of the alpha repository.


July   1, 1998: J. Apostolakis (pre-beta01-01)

- Geant4beta created from alpha07 tag (which was on a branch).


-----------------------------------------------------------------
These fixes were added to alpha07 - which was on a branch from
  the head

June  12, 1998: J. Apostolakis (for J. Sulkimo) 

- Correction to constructor of BREPSolidPCone. 
   (An out-of-date version was mistakenly included in fix to
    Conical Surface). 

June  10, 1998: J. Apostolakis (for J. Sulkimo) 

- Bug fixes to Conical Surface (FConical and Conical) to get
 PCone to work.  

------------------------------------------------------------------

June   8, 1998: J. Apostolakis breps-00-06-01

- Tagged what seems to be the last version before the merge 
of Peter Urban's code. Found this by using day before merge,
May 27th. 

April 28, 1998: G. Cosmo, breps-00-05-07

- Cleaned up trivial warnings on DEC (Extraneous semicolons).
- Removed -cfront option from GNUmakefile for DEC. -cfront
  overrides ANSI standard rules in cxx-6.0.

April 24, 1998: J. Sulkimo, breps-00-05-06

- fixed scope bugs in for loops

April 24, 1998: J. Sulkimo, breps-00-05-05-assembly

- G4Assembly.cc bug fixes in STEP file interaction & placed solids
  creation. Heavy changes in method G4Assembly::CopySTEPData

April 24, 1998: J. Sulkimo, breps-00-05-05-point3d

- rerenamed G4Point3d.hh to G4Point3d.h to avoid file name conflict on
  NT

April 23, 1998: G. Cosmo
- Added missing canonical implementation of operator== in G4PlacedSolid.hh


April 22, 1998: J. Sulkimo, breps-00-05-03-assembly (recorded by J.Apostolakis)

- Bug Fixes to G4Assembly, requiring changes to the files:

  include/G4Assembly.hh
  include/G4PlacedSolid.hh
  include/G4StepFileReader.hh
  src/G4Assembly.cc
  src/G4BREPSolid.cc
  src/G4CurveBoundary.cc
  src/G4PlacedSolid.cc
  src/G4Surface.cc


March 18, 1998: P. Urban, breps-00-05-02

- Names of lots of member functions changed:

  BoxOrNo to IsBox
  ConvexOrConcave to IsConvex
  + removing _ and capitalization.

  Cleanup of the code will continue later.


March 18, 1998: P. Urban, breps-00-05-01d

- Some member functions were removed. Renamed G4B_SplineCurve.

March 18, 1998: P. Urban, breps-00-05-01c

- the following classes have been renamed:

  from to

  G4B_SplineCurve G4BSplineCurve
  G4B_SplineCurve_With_Knots G4BSplineCurveWithKnots
  G4B_SplineSurface G4BSplineSurface
  G4Conic G4ConicalSurface
  G4Cylinder G4CylindricalSurface
  G4EllipticCurve G4Ellipse
  G4FConic G4FConicalSurface
  G4FCylinder G4FCylindricalSurface
  G4HyperbolicCurve G4Hyperbola
  G4ParabolicCurve G4Parabola
  G4PlaneSurface G4FPlane
  G4Rational_B_SplineCurve G4RationalBSplineCurve
  G4SpheShell G4SphericalSurface
  plane G4Plane
  uv_hit G4UVHit

March 18, 1998: P. Urban, breps-00-05-01b

- some class names will be changed; renaming the files (but not the classes!)
  was done.

March 18, 1998: P. Urban, breps-00-05-01a

- *.h files renamed to *.hh.

March 18, 1998: P. Urban, breps-00-05-01

- Modifications made before alpha05 which are not part of alpha05
  for some reason.
