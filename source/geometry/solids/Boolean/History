This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

   Please keep a summary of these message in geometry/History!

 May 26   2000  John Allison         geom-solid-bool-V01-01-00

  - Disabled CreatePolyhedron() method from G4UnionSolid, G4IntersectionSolid
    and G4SubtractionSolid. It now temporarly returns a NULL pointer.
    Visualisation of Boolean solids is therefore temporarly disabled, pending
    a definitive fix in graphics_reps.
    Files G4UnionSolid.cc, G4SubtractionSolid.cc and G4IntersectionSolid.cc
    are included in the branch-tag "boolean_nopoly_branch".

 Apr 27   2000  Gabriele Cosmo

  - Reorganised comments for the Software Reference Manual.
  - Added CVS headers and standard G4 header where missing.

 Apr 11   2000  John Allison

  - CreatePolyhedron implemented for BooleanSolids.
  - G4DisplacedSolid: reversed implementation of GetFrameRotation and
    GetObjectRotation, removing inappropriate invertion.
  - G4DisplacedSolid::GetConstituentMovedSolid() made const.

 Jan 19   2000	Gabriele Cosmo		geom-solid-bool-V01-00-00

  - Syncronized file versions with HEAD (essentially CVS headers changes)
  - Fixed cases of G4std::min which were not migrated on the HEAD in files:
    G4UnionSolid.cc and G4IntersectionSolid.cc

 Nov 24   1999 				geom-solid-bool-V00-01-05

  - Small fix in src/G4DisplacedSolid.cc to the return type 
         (const G4AffineTransform --> G4AffineTransform)
    to conform with the specification of the class.

 Nov 19   1999                          geom-solid-bool-V00-01-04

  -  Fixes from Vladimir, and additional tests

 Nov 10   1999                          geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03b

  - Renamed  GetConstituentSolid to GetConstituentMovedSolid in G4DisplacedSolid
     to avoid clashing with method that gets the contituents of a G4BooleanSolid.

 Nov 10   1999                          geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03a

  - Tag with additional methods for Persistency

 Nov 10   1999                          geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03-cand

  New method: Get Object Rotation/Translation methods in Displaced Solid

 Nov  9   1999                          geom-solid-bool-V00-01-02-cand
  
  - Tag with additional methods for Visualisation

   G4DisplacedSolid,  G4BooleanSolid

      Added methods to access data members:
          Get Constituent Solid  (int) for Boolean   Solid 
          Get Constituent Solid        for Displaced Solid 
          Get Frame Rotation/Translation methods in Displaced Solid



  Dec  1   1998   John Apostolakis                       geom-boolean-4-ja

    Code portability changes.

  Nov 27   1998   John Apostolakis & Vladimir Grichine   geom-boolean-3-vg

    Fixes agreed in code review were implemented.
