This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

   Please keep a summary of these message in geometry/History!

 Nov 2   2000  Gabriele Cosmo       geom-solid-bool-V02-00-01

  - QA code revision and cleanup (+fixes from CodeWizard filtering):
    o Added (private) declarations of copy constructor and assignment
      operator where needed.
    o Changed virtual functions to non-inline wherever's the case.

 Sep 13  2000  Vladimir Grichine    geom-solid-bool-V02-00-00

  - G4SubtractionSolid.cc: relaxed behavior in SurfaceNormal(p), where
    it is allowed for a point to be inside the solid. A message is thrown
    to cerr instead of a G4Exception.

 Jun 26  2000  Vladimir Grichine    geom-solid-bool-V01-01-03

  - Fixed bug in G4SubtractionSolid::DistanceToOut(p,v,...). validNorm
    flag was uncorrectly set to true. Fixes report #102.

 Jun 6   2000  John Apostolakis     geom-solid-bool-V01-01-02

  - Protecting the use of pointers validNorm and n, if calcNorm is false

 Jun 6   2000  John Allison         geom-solid-bool-V01-01-01

  - Re-enabled CreatePolyhedron() method from G4UnionSolid, G4IntersectionSolid
    and G4SubtractionSolid.  Coworks with greps-V01-01-04.

 May 26  2000  John Allison         geom-solid-bool-V01-01-00

  - Disabled CreatePolyhedron() method from G4UnionSolid, G4IntersectionSolid
    and G4SubtractionSolid. It now temporarly returns a NULL pointer.
    Visualisation of Boolean solids is therefore temporarly disabled, pending
    a definitive fix in graphics_reps.
    Files G4UnionSolid.cc, G4SubtractionSolid.cc and G4IntersectionSolid.cc
    are included in the branch-tag "boolean_nopoly_branch".

 Apr 27  2000  Gabriele Cosmo

  - Reorganised comments for the Software Reference Manual.
  - Added CVS headers and standard G4 header where missing.

 Apr 11  2000  John Allison

  - CreatePolyhedron implemented for BooleanSolids.
  - G4DisplacedSolid: reversed implementation of GetFrameRotation and
    GetObjectRotation, removing inappropriate invertion.
  - G4DisplacedSolid::GetConstituentMovedSolid() made const.

 Jan 19  2000	Gabriele Cosmo	    geom-solid-bool-V01-00-00

  - Syncronized file versions with HEAD (essentially CVS headers changes)
  - Fixed cases of G4std::min which were not migrated on the HEAD in files:
    G4UnionSolid.cc and G4IntersectionSolid.cc

 Nov 24  1999 			    geom-solid-bool-V00-01-05

  - Small fix in src/G4DisplacedSolid.cc to the return type 
         (const G4AffineTransform --> G4AffineTransform)
    to conform with the specification of the class.

 Nov 19  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-04

  -  Fixes from Vladimir, and additional tests

 Nov 10  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03b

  - Renamed  GetConstituentSolid to GetConstituentMovedSolid in G4DisplacedSolid
     to avoid clashing with method that gets the contituents of a G4BooleanSolid.

 Nov 10  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03a

  - Tag with additional methods for Persistency

 Nov 10  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03-cand

  New method: Get Object Rotation/Translation methods in Displaced Solid

 Nov  9  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-02-cand
  
  - Tag with additional methods for Visualisation

   G4DisplacedSolid,  G4BooleanSolid

      Added methods to access data members:
          Get Constituent Solid  (int) for Boolean   Solid 
          Get Constituent Solid        for Displaced Solid 
          Get Frame Rotation/Translation methods in Displaced Solid



  Dec  1  1998   John Apostolakis   geom-boolean-4-ja

    Code portability changes.

  Nov 27  1998   J.Apostolakis & V.Grichine   geom-boolean-3-vg

    Fixes agreed in code review were implemented.
