SurfaceChecker
====================================

The following two steps have to be executed in order:

1) SurfaceChecker run1.mac > data/yourfile.data

   Comments:
   - run1.mac can be replaced by some longer tests,e.g. runLong.mac
   - runspecial.mac is used to save the random number at the end of 
     a given event. Restart with runSingle.mac at the previous random
     number position.
   - You have to redirect the output to a file in the directory
     "data", with the filename extension ".data". 

2) extract.pl
   
   This perl script parses the output file (located in the "data" 
   directory) and converts the information into a ntuple. The file will
   have the same name as your data file (e.g. yourfile.hbk) and will
   be stored in the directory "hbk".
   The format of the ntuple (with Id 1) is the following:

	 phi,u :    surface parameters
	 x,y,z:     generated (true) surface point in cartesian coordinates
	 px,py,pz:  vertex position in cartesian coordinates
	 dist:      (true) distance between vertex and intersection
	 vx,vy,vz:  momentum of particle at vertex
	 rx,ry,rz:  reconstructed intersection 
	 delta :    distance between reconstructed and true intersection
	 theta:     angle between momentum and surface normal at intersection
