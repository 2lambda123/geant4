                      Sub-Category History file
                      -------------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all directory-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Apr   27th, 2000   G. Cosmo

- Updated comments for the Software Reference Manual in "Boolean", added
  CVS and standard G4 headers where missing.

Apr   18th, 2000   D. Williams

- Minor fixes and cosmectics in "specific" solids. Removed dependency
  over the CSG module.
- Updated SBT test to cope with new shapes in "specific".

Apr   11th, 2000   J. Allison

- Removed implementations of GetExtent in most sub-classes of G4VSolid (a
  default implementation exists in G4VSolid).
- All implementations of DescribeYourselfTo (G4VGraphicsScene& scene) const
  now correctly written: scene.AddThis(*this).
- CreatePolyhedron implemented for BooleanSolids.
- G4DisplacedSolid: reversed implementation of GetFrameRotation and
  GetObjectRotation, removing inappropriate invertion.
- G4DisplacedSolid::GetConstituentMovedSolid() made const.

Apr    5th, 2000   G. Cosmo                -  geomsolids-V01-01-00

- Restructured CSG directory:
  o moved all shapes which are non-pure CSG to solids/specific.
    See related History files for more details.
  o moved unit-tests to appropriate test directories.
  o extracted tests "SBT" and "Fred" and placed one level up in
    solids/tests (new directory).
- Fixes to G4Tubes.cc and G4Hype[.hh.cc].
- Added new shape in solids/specific: G4EllipticalTube.
- Organised class description comments for the Software Reference Manual
  in CSG and specific headers. Added CVS headers to files in specific.

Jan   19th, 2000   G. Cosmo                -  geomsolids-V01-00-00

- Syncronized HEAD versioning of files after ISO-C++ migration
  (essentially CVS headers changes).
- CSG: fixed bug in DistanceToIn(p,v). (V.Grichine)
  Modified files: G4Trap.cc and testG4Trap.cc.
