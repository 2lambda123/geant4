           History file for geometry/solids/STEPinterface
	   ----------------------------------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

     ----------------------------------------------------------

09th November 2000  Gabriele Cosmo  (stepinterface-V02-00-00)
- QA code revision and cleanup (+fixes from CodeWizard filtering):
  o Changed return value to "const char*" to method Name() and made
    post-const in all creator classes.
  o Made virtual methods not inlined in G4GeometryCreator.
  o Moved public data members to protected/private in G4GeometryCreator
    and G4AssemblyCreator.
  o G4AssemblyCreator: defined private copy-constructor and operator=.
  o Fix in G4Axis2Placement3dCreator::CreateSTEPGeometry(void*) where
    G4Point3D was casted to G4Vector3D by mistake (!).

25th February 2000  Gabriele Cosmo  (stepinterface-V01-00-01)
- Improved overall diagnostics.
- Fixed internal memory-leaks.
- Added protections for NULL pointers generated by missing geometry creators.
  Updated files: G4VectorCreator.cc, G4ToroidalSurfaceCreator.cc,
  G4SphericalSurfaceCreator.cc, G4ShapeRepresentationCreator.cc,
  G4RationalBSplineSurfaceCreator.cc, G4PlaneCreator.cc,
  G4OrientedEdgeCreator.cc, G4LineCreator.cc,
  G4ItemDefinedTransformationCreator.cc, G4EllipseCreator.cc,
  G4EdgeLoopCreator.cc, G4EdgeCurveCreator.cc, G4CylindricalSurfaceCreator.cc,
  G4ConicalSurfaceCreator.cc, G4ClosedShellCreator.cc, G4CircleCreator.cc,
  G4BoundedSurfaceCreator.cc, G4BSplineCurveWithKnotsCreator.cc,
  G4Axis2Placement3dCreator.cc, G4AdvancedFaceCreator.cc,
  G4AdvancedBrepShapeRepresentationCreator.cc
- G4AdvancedFaceCreator.cc, G4EdgeLoopCreator.cc
  o added check over the number of allocated curves for composition.
- G4ClosedShellCreator.cc
  o added check over the number of allocated surfaces for composition.
- G4BSplineSurfaceWithKnotsCreator.cc
  o created object is now a G4BSplineSurface. No G4 object was returned before.
- G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator[.hh.cc]:
  o fixed bound-overflow problem on array of placements.
  o implemented temporary solution for association of placements and
    manifolded solids for advanced BREP shape representations.
  o added protections for NULL pointers.
- G4GeometryTable.cc:
  o added extra-debug verbosity protected by G4_STEPINTERFACE_DEBUG flag.
- G4AssemblyCreator.cc:
  o STEPfile_id is now retrieved through direct call to STEP reader function
    GetApplication_instance(keyw, index).
  o added extra-debug verbosity protected by G4_STEPINTERFACE_DEBUG flag.
  o added protection for NULL pointers.
- test/GNUmakefile:
  o moved to use granular libraries.

21st January 2000  Gabriele Cosmo  (stepinterface-V01-00-00)
- Code migrated to handle new NIST STEP Reader SCL 3.2.
- Reduced inter-class dependencies by reorganising include statements and
  removing unnecessary ones.
- Added standard class header description and CVS identifiers.
- Code porting to supported UNIX platforms/compilers. 

8th November 1999  Gabriele Cosmo  (stepinterface-V00-01-00)
- Added files G4NISTStepReader[.hh.cc] and G4StepFileReader[.hh] from BREPS.
- Added inclusion of STEPcomplex.h in G4BoundedSurfaceCreator.cc,
  G4GeometryCreator.cc and G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator.cc.

6th February 1999  John Allison  stepinterface-01-00-00 on ONE FILE ONLY...
- Commented out some troublesome printing in G4GeometryTable.cc.  Changes
  (a) in branch stepintf-geant4-00-branch (from geant4-00), (b) in branch
   stepintf-01-00-00-branch, and (c) in head of G4GeometryTable.cc.

revision 1.9
date: 1998/12/09 12:00:42;  author: broglia;  state: Exp;  lines: +22 -37
December 9, 1998 : L. Broglia
 - Make the possibility to read a STEP file containing
   an assembly of assemblies.

   G4AdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation can have 1 or more
   Manifold solid, so the creator return an array of
   G4BREPSolid (class G4BREPSolidVector)

   G4ContextDependentShapeRepresentationCreator and
   G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator create G4AdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation,
   so I modified the 'return' type (now G4BREPSolidVector)

   G4AssemblyCreator create an assembly of solids, so a STEP file containing
   an assembly of assemblies is saved into an assembly of solids.

----------------------------
revision 1.6

November 17, 1998 : L. Broglia
  - Modify  G4AssemblyCreator, made of 0 or 1 Axis2Placement3D
    and 1 or more ManifoldSolidBrep


November 6, 1998  L. Broglia

 - Implement CreateG4Geometry in G4CircleCreator, G4CylindricalSurfaceCreator,
  G4CylindricalSurfaceCreator.cc, G4SphericalSurfaceCreator.cc

----------------------------
revision 1.4
date: 1998/07/29 00:45:22;  author: gcosmo;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -1

revision 1.2
date: 1998/07/10 20:55:42;  author: japost;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
  Changed
    ::G4GeometryTable::Register
  to
    G4GeometryTable::Register
  in order to allow it to compile on DEC-AFS.

  Also deleted unneeded ";" after {} of functions. (Warnings on DEC)
