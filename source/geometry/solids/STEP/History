This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every

September 19, 2001      Gabriele Cosmo (STEP-V03-02-00)
- dirobj.cc: restored usage of strdup() and force non-ansi compilation in GNUmakefile
  for Linux-g++, to avoid incompatibilities on the usage of C strings operations
  when "-ansi -pedantic" is adopted.

June 18, 2001           Gabriele Cosmo (STEP-V03-01-00)
- dirobj.cc: removed usage of strdup() to allow porting on Linux-g++ -ansi
  setup. Replaced with existing solution for __O3DB__.

April 20, 2001          Gabriele Cosmo
- Minor fixes for removing some pedantic warnings from Linux-g++,
  modified files: scl_hash.cc, scl_string.cc.

November 20, 2000	Gabriele Cosmo (STEP-V02-00-00)
- Fixes to remove warnings from "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" g++ compiler options:
  o commented out variables declared and not used.
  o fixed declaration of variables used before being initialised.
  o dirobj.h: protected from missing definition of MAXNAMLEN, S_IFMT and
    S_IFDIR originally defined in /usr/include/sys/stat.h.
  o fixed order of initialisation of member data in constructors.

June 14, 2000		Gabriele Cosmo (STEP-V01-01-00)
- Fixes for porting on Win/NT VC++:
  o dirobj[.h.cc]: deactivated Reset() and Home() functions.
  o scl_cf.h: undefine HAVE_UNISTD_H for WIN32.
  o stat.h: don't use hard-coded path for <sys/stat.h> on WIN32.
  o ExpDict.cc: don't declare external memmove() for WIN32.
  o STEPcomplex.cc, SdaiCONFIG_CONTROL_DESIGN.cc: use explicit typedef
    StepApplicationInstanceType for SDAI::Application_instance and
    StepSelectType for SDAI::Select respectively, when invoking a method
    of the base class in scope.

February 14, 2000	Gabriele Cosmo (STEP-V01-00-01)
- Fixes for porting on supported platforms/compilers:
  o STEPfile.h: removed declaration of function HeaderId(int)
    since not used and NOT implemented;
  o sdai[.h.cc]: replaced use of MAXLONG and MINFLOAT with LONG_MAX
    and FLT_MIN respectively.
  o STEPfile_inline.cc: added explicit cast to float in argument for
    'ceil' function.

January 31, 2000	Gabriele Cosmo (STEP-V01-00-00)
- Upgraded NIST STEP Reader to SCL (STEP Class Library) 3.2.
- Implemented porting on supported platforms/compilers.
- Implemented changes for ISO-ANSI C++ compliance.
- Added README and History files.
