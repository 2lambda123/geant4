This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all directory-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

   I've committed new versions of the CSG Polycone and Polyhedra in the
 geant4 repository, including a new utility class called
 G4ReduciblePolygon. The new versions fix several subtle bugs which my  
 "test3" batch geometry testing code uncovered. In addition, the new class
 G4ReduciblePolygon is used to run strict tests on the validity of input
 parameters.
   To fix a bug in Polyhedra, I had to back out some fancy code that
 allowed it to calculate intersections at a speed that was independent of
 the number of sides. The new version now runs at a speed proportional to
 the number of sides, and is thus much slower for polyhedras with many
 sides. I can fix this, but I thought it would be best to get the bug fixes
 in as soon as possible.
