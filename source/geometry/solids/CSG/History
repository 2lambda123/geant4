   Added initialisation to Eside "side" variable in DistanceToOut(p,v)
   in CSG solids.    
                            --> Problem report from D.C. Williams, BaBaR

   A check in G4Trap Makeplane added.

  - Included  David Williams' modifications to 
        G4IntersectingCone.cc, G4PolyconeSide.cc and G4VCSGfaceted.cc

     and to  test/SBT/SBT.cc  and  test/SBT/polycone.geant4

  Replaced 1/DBL_MAX with DBL_MIN (valid correction, seen in tests for STL) 
    in G4PolyPhiFace.cc, G4PolyconeSide.cc and G4PolyhedraSide.cc

Apr 29,   99   David Wiliams

  G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone (and G4VCSGfaceted) modified:
         1. Implemented correct copy constructors and assignment operators.
         2. Fix some leaks for tracks that pass exactly through an edge. 
            Some leaks still remain: particularly if a track passes through
	     a corner and between the curved edges of G4Polycone.
         3. G4Polyhedra argument numSide changed to G4int (from G4double)

Apr 13,   99   Vladimir Grichine and Simone Giani

 Minor consistency fix to 8 basic CSG solids: 
   Tolerance used in calculation of extent but not in one place, and not another
   - this tripped up the client code. 

Feb 16,   99   David Williams

  Repaired bugs in G4Polycone (G4PolyconeSide.cc) as found in
  test/testG4Polycone and missed in below.
  
  Updated definition of DistanceToIn(p) and DistanceToOut(p) to
  return zero when the point p is on the surface of the solid.

Feb 12,   99   David Williams

  src/G4PolyconeSide.cc updated (revision 1.4) to fix a bug discovered by
  test/testG4Polycone.

Feb   9,  99   David C. Williams      (davidw@scipp.ucsc.edu)

   I've committed new versions of the CSG Polycone and Polyhedra in the
 geant4 repository, including a new utility class called
 G4ReduciblePolygon. The new versions fix several subtle bugs which my  
 "test3" batch geometry testing code uncovered. In addition, the new class
 G4ReduciblePolygon is used to run strict tests on the validity of input
 parameters.
   To fix a bug in Polyhedra, I had to back out some fancy code that
 allowed it to calculate intersections at a speed that was independent of
 the number of sides. The new version now runs at a speed proportional to
 the number of sides, and is thus much slower for polyhedras with many
 sides. I can fix this, but I thought it would be best to get the bug fixes
 in as soon as possible.
