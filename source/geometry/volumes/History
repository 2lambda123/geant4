May      19, 99      J.Apostolakis, F. Behner

   In G4Navigator: Changed cout -> G4cout
		   Changed protection for printing of Physical volume name:
		    (because of warning on SUN;  same functionality)


   In G4NavigationLevel, created an optional operator delete(void *, void *)
    this is accepted by DEC, and not accepted by SUN, HP
    new flag created in architecture for protection: ~ G4NO_ISO_DELETES 

May      17, 99      J. Allison.
   In G4NavigationLevel, changed operator new(size_t, G4NavigationLevel *)
   to operator new(size_t, void *) because the former is not accepted
   by Sun CC 4.2 (with STL Interface.)

May       3, 99      J. Apostolakis 
   testG4ReplicaNavigation.cc
      Changed comparison of doubles, to give it a tolerance.  

April     8, 99      (committed & recorded J. Apostolakis  May 3rd)
   G4NavigationLevel.{hh,icc}: Minor Changes 
      added const to copy constructor and
      new 'new' operator with size_t - for STL use with preallocated containers" 


March    19, 99      J. Apostolakis        geomvol-01-00-03

   New tag for replica fix.


March    18, 99      J. Apostolakis

   A fix for looping in Replicas:
        In the case where a zero step is done in Replicas, we must allow
    ReplicaNavigator to handle the case itself - or else we loop.

March    11, 99      J. Apostolakis

   G4GRSVolume.icc: corrected G4Exception messages.

February 18, 99      J. Apostolakis        

 include/G4VoxelNavigation.hh
 src/G4VoxelNavigation.cc    : overwrote versions 1.2 with production version
      --->  when changes are refined and retested, they could be reincorporated

February 17, 99      J. Apostolakis        geomvol-01-00-02

 Moved G4PropagatorInField here from magneticfield to remove correct
  dependency.

February 15, 99      J. Apostolakis        geomvol-01-00-01

   Only fixes in G4Navigator's incorporated.
   GNUmakefile corrected (for SUN-CC).

January      99,     J. Apostolakis

Fix for ComputeSafety in Navigator:                              G4Navigator.cc
            the voxel information that was used was incorrect       v 1.3
                -> it resulted in wrong value of safety


December     98                                   geant4-00-RandD

 include/G4VoxelNavigation.hh
 src/G4VoxelNavigation.cc    : versions 1.2 are trial versions from beta "head"

December     98                                   

Trial fix for navigation in replicas                             G4Navigator.cc
                                                                    v 1.2
         (a problem persists with this version)


December     98                                   geant4-00

   Code moved: production tag from beta repository.
