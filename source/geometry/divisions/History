                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

December 2nd, 2004      G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-02-02)
- Implemented migration to <cmath> for standard mathematical functions.

August 26th, 2004       G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-02-01)
- G4PVDivision.cc: removed unnecessary debub printout in
  CheckAndSetParamenters().

June 15th, 2004         G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-02-00)
- Removed unnecessary forward declaration of HepTransform3D from
  G4ParameterisationBox.hh and G4VDivisionParameterisation.hh.

May 17th, 2004          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-01-01)
- Corrected handling of offset in Z for reflection.

May 13th, 2004          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-01-00)
- Added support for reflection of divided volumes (courtesy of I.Hrivnacova):
  o Added concrete istance of division-factory G4PVDivisionFactory
    for the creation of volume divisions on demand.
  o Enhanced unit-test suite "ExDivisions" to support reflections with
    additional input argument for positioning type (normal/reflected).
  o Coworks with tags: geommng-V06-01-00, geomvol-V06-01-00 and
                       geom-bool-V06-01-00.

Nov 19th, 2003          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-07)
- Moved verbose output between G4DIVDEBUG compilation flag.
- Added testing framework for divisions to be used also as base for user's example.
- General cleanup.

Nov 18th, 2003          P.Arce  (geomdiv-V05-02-06)
- Added divisions in X and Y for G4Para.
- Added divisions in Z for G4Polycone and G4Polyhedra.
- Fixed handling of offsets and added more checks.

Nov 4th, 2003           G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-05)
- Fixes in the logic of resetting parameters in ComputeDimension() for
  polycones and polyhedra. Requires tag "geom-specific-V05-02-05".
- Implementation NOT yet complete for division in Z for polycones and
  for division in Phi and Z for polyhedra.

Oct 31st, 2003          P.Arce  (geomdiv-V05-02-04)
- First implementation for G4Polyhedra.

Oct 31st, 2003          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-03a)
- Fixed compilation errors on Windows.

Oct 24th, 2003          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-03)
- Completed implementation for Para, Trd. (by P.Arce)
- Corrections for cons and tubs.
- First trial implementation for polyhedra.
- Migrated calls to G4Exception to new scheme.
- Added G4Orb to dummy parameterisations.

Sep 30th, 2003          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-02)
- Removed concrete implementation of Setup() method, according to
  changes made to base class G4VPhysicalVolume.
- Updated GNUmakefile for unit tests, according to new structure
  introduced in "geometry-V05-02-00".

Jul 4th, 2003           G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-01)
- Removed useless test header...

Jun 16th, 2003		G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-00)
- Code cleanup and restructured.
- Created.
  Original implementation by P.Arce Dubois (University of Cantabria, CMS).
