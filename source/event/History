This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Nov 10 2000, F.Lei
- Adding src and include sub-directory and files to test/GeneralParticleSource
- Improving the speed in  G4GeneralParticleSource::GenerateIsotropicFlux() and
   G4GeneralParticleSource::GenerateCoslawFlux()
-    some bug fixing:
          i) dclared ' G4int count' in all ****Interpolation functions
          ii) added ' return (0.) ' to GenerateUserDefTheta and GenerateUserDefPhi 
              as default.
	  iii) changed
	       #include <iostream.h>
		 to #include "g4std/fstream"
	      in G4GeneralParicleSourceMessenger.cc

Nov 9 2000, M.Asai (tag event-V02-00-02)
- Adding /source/event/test and GeneralParticleSource sub-directory.

Oct 31 2000, F.Lei
  G4GeneralParticleSource:
  G4GeneralParticleSourceMessenger: 
 	G4GeneralParticleSource is an alternative primary source
	generator to G4ParticleGun. It has all the functions of 
	G4ParticleGun plus many options for specifing the primary 
	event particle and vertex.

 - added  -I$(G4BASE)/global/HEPNumerics/include \
      to GNUMakefile


Oct 19 2000, M.Asai (tag event-V02-00-01)
  G4ParticleGun :  Add Set/GetParticleCharge methods for ions.
  G4ParticleGunMessenger : Add new command of /gun/ion
                         : Modify command of /gun/particle
  G4PrimaryParticle : Add Set/GetCharge methods
                    : Add weight
  G4PrimaryVertex : Add weight
  G4PrimaryTransformer : Use G4PrimaryParticle::GetCharge to give dynamic charge
                         in G4DynamicParticle
                       : Set weight of G4Track 

July 22 2000, M.Asai (tag event-V02-00-00)

Sep. 21, 98 M.Asai (tag event-00-03-01)
- Inclusion of "G4HCofThisEvent.hh" and "G4DCofThisEvent.hh" moved
  from "G4Event.cc" to "G4Event.hh", to avoid the link problem on
  HP-CC (not aCC).

July 19, 98 M.Asai (tag event-00-01-03)
