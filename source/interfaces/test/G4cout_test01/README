		README G4cout_test01:

					Nov. 3 1998
					Masayasu Nagamatu

This example program illustrates how to use "setCoutDestination" of G4cout
in order to redirect the stream.
The documentation of G4cout/G4cerr is found in the sections 2.1.6 and 3.15
of the User's Guide of GEANT4.

This example is created after examples/novice/exampleN01 which is a pure batch
one. But this example can redirect the output to a file named "Mylog".


1) Only one class "Mysession" (src/Mysession.cc and include/Mysession.hh) is
added to the original ExN01 classes. The class "Mysession"  is derived 
from G4UIsession and implements two methods to receive the stream 
of G4cout and G4cerr respectively.
      ReceiveG4cout(session)
      ReceiveG4cerr(session)
 
2) G4cout_test01.cc  has a line to instantiate the "session" of the above class.
