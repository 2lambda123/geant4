Installation instructions:

 - Download the tar files of the physics simulation engine you want to use.
 - 'tar -xvf', whereever you want into the directory 'hadronic'.
 - set the environment:
   - G4INSTALL as usual to point to your geant4 installation.
   - G4LISTS_BASE to point to the directory that contains the 'hadronic'
     directory for your specific installation of the hadronic physics-lists.
   - If you wish to work against the 'central' physics-lists installation,
     do NOT set G4LISTS_BASE, and use G4WORKDIR as usual.
   - type 'make' from the directory 'hadronic'.
   - copy the example GNUmakefile (GNUmakefile.user.code.example), that comes
     with the package, to our application area and uncomment the physics lists
     you wish to use.
   - To clean the installation of the physics-lists, you can type
     "gmake clean_lists" from $G4INSTALL/source in your Geant4 installation.
 
Setting default cut values:
 - The default is: defaultCutValue = 0.7*mm;  
 - To override this value, please call the 
   "void SetDefaultCutValue(G4double newCutValue)" method.
