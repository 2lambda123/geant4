   - (optional) G4LISTS_BASE, if you have your own physics lists area
     installation point different from the default one. G4LISTS_BASE must
     point to the 'physics_lists' directory that contains the subdirectory
     'hadronic'.
   - type 'gmake' from physics_lists/hadronic directory
   - copy the provided GNUmakefile.user.code.example file
     to your application area and uncomment the 
     physics lists you decided to employ.
 
Setting default cut values:
 - The default is: defaultCutValue = 0.7*mm;  
 - To override this value, please call the 
  "void SetDefaultCutValue(G4double newCutValue)" method of the Physics List.

Verbosity Level:
 - verbosity level of any Physics List can be established via its
   constructor, e.g. "new QGSP(0)" means 0 verbosity level for
   the Physics List. The default level is 1.
