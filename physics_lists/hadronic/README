Installation instructions:
 - Down load the tar files of the physics simulation engine you want to use.
 - 'tar -xvf', whereever you want into a diretory called 'lists'.
 - set the environment:
   - G4INSTALL as usual to point to your geant4 installation.
   - LISTS_BASE to point to the directory below the 'lists' directory.
   - type 'gmake' for each physics list, and the packaging library.
   - copy the example GNUmakefile, that comes with the Packaging 
     library tar-file, to our application area and uncomment the 
     physics lists you decided to employ.
   - If you wish to work against a 'central' physics lists installation,
     point LISTS_BASE to the installation, and use G4WORKDIR as usual.
 
Setting default cut values:
 - The default is: defaultCutValue = 0.7*mm;  
 - To override this value, please call the 
  "void SetDefaultCutValue(G4double newCutValue)" method.
