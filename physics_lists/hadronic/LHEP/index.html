  The LHEP physics list models and cross-section:
  <ul>
  <li>
  The cross-section used by the LHEP list are the default geant4 cross-sections.
  No special data sets are applied to keep performance at its maximum.
  Verification plots for these cross-sections can be found 
  <a href="../lists/QGSC.tar">here</a>.
 
  <li>
  The model used for elastic scattering is the G4LElastic model. It models the
  scattering angle based on a two slope parametrization.
  Verification plots for this can be found 
  <a href="../lists/QGSC.tar">here</a>.
  <li>
  The models used for inelastic scattering are the LEP and HEP parametrized 
  models. The modeling parametrizes the final states individual inelastic reactions, so you will not see
  resonances, and the detailed secondary angular distributions for O(100MeV) reactions may not be described
  perfectly. The average quantities will be well described. 
  Verification plots for this can be found 
  <a href="../lists/QGSC.tar">here</a>.
  <li>
  The models used for hadronic interactions of
  stopping particles are a direct re-write from geant3.21.
  In the case of mu- absorption, the particles from the electromagnetic
  cascading prior to capture are taken into account in addition. Capture is in
  competition with decay, and effects of the electromagnetic
  binding on mu- decay have been added.
  Verification plots can be found 
  <a href="../lists/QGSC.tar">here</a>.
  <li>
  The electromagnetic physics used is the 'standard' geant4 
  electromagnetic physics. A production threshold of 0.7mm is applied.
  Please refere to the pages of the electromagnetic working group for
  verification results of these processes.
