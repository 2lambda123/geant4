                      Electromagnetic PhysicsList
                      ---------------------------

     The example of physics list for standard electromagnetic physics
     package is presented in the subdirectory

     electromagnetic/standard

     The corresponding files are PhysicsList.cc, .hh
     Physics list is equipped by the messenger, which allows to set
     cuts and to define modules of physics to be used.
     The following modules can be activated:

     1. "standard"    - (alternative) standard EM physics (current version)
     2. "standard71"  - (alternative) standard EM physics with multiple 
                        scattering process version from G4 7.1p01
     3. "g4v52"       - (alternative) standard EM physics (version G4 5.2p02)
     4. "high_energy" - add high energy processes
     5. "step_limit"  - add step limit for charged particles
     6. "decay"       - add list of default decays

     To activate a specific module the UI command can be used:
     "/testem/phys/addPhysics  title"
     By default "standard" module is loaded.

     The PhysicsList options can be defined via G4EmProcessOptions
     class, the example of the usage is in the PhysicsList class

     It is NOT assumed that files from this subdirectory will be
     compiled directly. User can copy or link these files to
     his/her application, to modify this example according to the
     particular application. 

     It is assumed that user will add modules to this PhysicsList.

     This PhysicsList approach is used in tests of the standard
     electromagnetic package. Similar PhysicsLists can be found out
     in advance examples.

     The direct test of this PhysicsList is performed in the example
     examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm2, TestEm9
