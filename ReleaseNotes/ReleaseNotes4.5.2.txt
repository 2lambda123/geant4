                          ------------------------

                                                      27 June 2003

The code and some binary libraries are available through our "Source Code"
Web page (http://cern.ch/geant4).

Please refer to the Geant4 User Documentation
(http://cern.ch/geant4/G4UsersDocuments/Overview/html)
for further information about using Geant4.

1. Supported and Tested Platforms
---------------------------------

  o SUN Solaris 5.8, C++ 5.4 Patch 111715-02.
  o Linux, gcc 2.95.2, gcc 3.2.
      This configuration was tested with the RedHat 7.3 distribution,
      versions of Geant4 have also been compiled successfully on other
      Linux distributions, like Debian or Suse.
      The default RedHat compiler gcc-2.96 distributed in RedHat 7.X is NOT
      supported. It has been verified that it produces incorrect binaries,
      therefore is not reliable. See also note below.
  o Windows-2000/XP and CygWin Tools with: Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 5

Platforms configured but not tested and not supported:
  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027
  o HP 10.20, aCC C++ B3910B A.01.23
  o SGI V6.5.5, CC 7.2.1
  o AIX 4.3.2, xlC 6.0 
  o MacOS 10.2, gcc 2.95.2 / gcc-3.2
  o Windows/XP with CygWin Tools, .NET Visual Studio C++ 7


2. AIDA and CLHEP
-----------------

Geant4 5.2 requires the installation of CLHEP
(http://cern.ch/clhep/INSTALLATION/clhep.html).
Tests have been performed with CLHEP 1.8.0.0.

Geant4 5.2 examples with histogramming cowork with AIDA 3.0 implementations.
These include:
- ANAPHE and components included therein
  (see: ANAPHE - http://cern.ch/anaphe)
- JAS (Java Analysis Studio)
  (see: JAS - http://jas.freehep.org)
- Open Scientist
  (see: Open Scientist - http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/OpenScientist)

AIDA headers can be downloaded from:
  http://aida.freehep.org


3. The Standard Template Library
--------------------------------

Native versions of STL have been tested on the following platforms:

   Windows/2000, Linux, and SUN.

NOTES:

- Platform specific setup:
  o SUN:     Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup.
  o Linux:   Native STL is required (non ISO/ANSI setup for egcs compiler only).
  o Windows: Native STL and ISO/ANSI setup required.


4. Compiler Specific Problems
-----------------------------

  o Linux Red Hat 7.X, gcc-2.96.

    - The default compiler distributed by Red Hat since release 7.0 is
      NOT supported and not considered reliable for running a Geant4-based
      application. In more than one test case, binaries produced by gcc-2.96
      have shown incorrect behavior, either due to wrong order of
      initialisation of static data in memory or to bugs in the system
      iostream classes, problems which apparently have all been solved in
      more recent versions of the compiler (3.X series).
      For information, gcc-2.96 is a compiler that has never been
      officially released, nor supported by the GNU team itself and is not
      considered reliable by the authors (for more information, see also
      http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.96.html).


5. Known Run-Time Problems and Limitations
------------------------------------------

For a complete list of outstanding run-time problems and to submit any
problem you may find running this version of Geant4, please refer to the
Geant4 Problem Reporting System, available on the Web at this address:

    http://cern.ch/geant4/problemreport


6. Compilation Warnings
-----------------------

There are compilation warnings on some platforms.  We do not believe
that any will lead to incorrect run-time behaviour, but we are working
on reducing them.


7. Known Run-Time Warnings
--------------------------

The following messages can be written to error output while tracking.
We believe none give rise to incorrect behaviour.

  o G4PropagateInField: Warning: Particle is looping 
    -  tracking in field will be stopped. 
       It has performed 1000 steps in Field while a maximum of 1000
       are allowed. 


8. Features at Run-Time
-----------------------

  o In the propagation in field, the default value of "maximum step count"
    has been changed from 10000 to 1000.
    This will cause more particles to be recognised to loop earlier as this
    parameter controls this behavior too.

9. Items for migration of user code
-----------------------------------

  o With this release, usage of the obsolete 'g4std' wrappers has been removed
    from the code and wrappers themselves are now hard-coded to STL headers.
    User code making use of these wrappers will still compile and run as
    normal, however, we encourage to migrate the user code at the earliest
    convenience.
    From the -next- public release (and development/beta releases), wrappers
    and definition of 'G4std' will be removed, therefore making the migration
    of the user code mandatory:
      - Any reference to G4std:: will have to be changed to std::
      - Any #include statement of the kind
          #include "g4std/XXX"
        will have to migrate to standard C++ calls of the kind
          #include <XXX>
  o The new data sets for low-energy EM processes G4EMLOW2.2 is required
    for applications making use of such processes.
