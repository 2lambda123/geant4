Major development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o 

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

(#)  Fixes included in release 10.1.p01

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

analysis                                         analysis-V10-01-06
--------
- Fixed G4AnalysisManager::IsActive() - now taken into all Hn & Pn managers. (#)
- Fixed false warnings about unknown column type when an ntuple contains 
  a column of a vector type and is created via ntuple booking.
- Fixed reading XML ntuples with a column of a vector type; tools do not
  support direct use of ntuple_bindings with a vector, use of a temporary
  sub-ntuple is needed.

digits_hits/utils                                detutils-V10-01-01          (#)
-----------------
- Added calls to G4VisManager::BeginDraw2D() and  G4VisManager::EndDraw()
  in G4VScoreColorMap to speedup drawing of texts and color chart.
  Revised Draw() DrawColumn() methods in G4ScoringBox and G4ScoringCylinder
  to speed up drawing primitive scorers attached to the scoring meshes.

externals/usolids                                geom-usolids-V10-01-09

- biasing (geombias-V10-01-00)                                               (#)
  o Made G4IStore and G4WeightWindowStore singletons thread-local to avoid
    data races when accessing iterators.
    Use const references for string in argument for constructor and accessor.
- management (geommng-V10-01-00)
  o G4USolid: use accessors x(), y() and z() from UVector3, instead of

-------------
- HepPolyhedron: corrected a long-standing spelling mistakes.
  This is reflected in the method names, but the old names have been

-----------------
- G4ImportanceProcess, G4WeightCutOffProcess, G4WeightWindowProcess:
  made static thread-local variables into simple class data members.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V10-01-10
-------------------------------
- G4EmCalculator: moved simple methods to inline; added public method
  SetupMaterial() for computation of cross-section per atom, to add
  initialisation of material (problem observed in Bremsstrahlung
  cross-section). Minor fix of printout.
- G4LossTableManager: moved run time methods to be inlined.
- G4EmParameters, G4EmParametersMessenger: added new methods and respecitve
  UI commands for muon/hadron/ion multiple scattering: 
  SetMscMuHadRangeFactor(), SetMscMuHadStepLimitType();
  /process/msc/RangeFactorMuHad, /process/msc/StepLimitMuHad.
  Use new methods in G4VMultipleScattering.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- cross_sections (hadr-cross-V10-01-05)
  o G4CrossSectionDataSetRegistry, G4VCrossSectionDataSet: defined as 
    G4ThreadLocalSingleton; delete all x-sections at exit except HP.

    deletion at exit.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V10-01-20)
  o Moved G4NeutronRadCapture to handler sub-directory; use G4ExcitationHandler
    instead of G4PhotonEvaporation allowing to have not only gamma de-excitation
    but also fission or FermiBreakUp.
  o G4VEvaporationChannel, G4VEvaporation, G4VEvaporationChannel: moved 
    setters from G4PhotonEvaporation to reduce number of new/delete at
    initialisation.
  o Moved new nuclear data structure classes to 'management' module
    Removed obsolete G4E1SingleProbability1, G4VPhotonEvaporation classes.
  o G4WilsonAblationModel, G4EvaporationFactory, G4EvaporationFactory,
    G4ExcitationHandler: use default constructor of G4Evaporation and access
    photon evaporation class from G4Evaporation.
  o G4Evaporation: use environment variable "G4UsePromptPhotonEvaporation"
    to select gamma de-excitation model; if the variable is defined
    the new G4PromptPhotonEvaporation class is used.
  o G4PromptPhotonEvaporation, G4LevelReader, G4NucLevel: code cleanup.
  o Fixed Coverity defects.
  o Removed unused dependences from CMake script.

- models/lepto_nuclear (hadr-lepnuc-V10-01-00)
  o G4MuonVDNuclearModel: defined G4KokoulinMuonNuclearXS via factory interface
