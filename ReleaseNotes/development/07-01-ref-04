                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Introduced first implementation for optional check of overlaps at
    construction to G4PVPlacement and G4PVParameterised volumes. Default
    resolution of 1000 points is defined for the check.
  o Archived old TRD parameterised models. Functionality now included
    in standard EM processes.
  o New MSC models (G4MultipleScattering80 and G4MscModel80) become the
    default.
  o Fixes for initialization and for angular distribution in
    G4MuBremsstrahlungModel and G4MuPairProductionModel.
  o New RayTracerX visualization driver selectable at build time.

  distribution of e+, e- and energy momentum balance.

    scaled with mass for other particles). Soft limit: facrange increases
    linearly with energy above Tkinlimit.

    no physics performance degradation and weaker cut dependence. 
  o Fixed bug in TruePathLengthLimit and problem with non-initilised
    variable.

  o Nuclear size correction are removed, the correction is already
    included in the (theoretical) tabulated cross section values for
    Tkin > 10 MeV.
- G4UniversalFluctuation:
  o Cut dependence of the energy-loss distribution has been reduced.
  o Introduced correction for very small loss to avoid zero energy loss.

- G4VEmProcess: set default lambda-factor to 0.8.
- G4EmManager: fixed a cut calculation for e+e- pair.
- G4VMultipleScattering: corrected error in a protection in
  GetContinuousStepLimit().
