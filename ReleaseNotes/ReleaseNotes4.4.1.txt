1. Supported and Tested Platforms
---------------------------------

  o SUN Solaris 5.7, C++ 5.2 Patch 109508-03.
  o Linux, gcc 2.95.2, egcs-2.91.66 (egcs 1.1.2).
      This configuration was tested with the RedHat 6.1 and 7.2 distributions,
      versions of Geant4 have also been compiled successfully on other Linux
      distributions, like Debian or Suse.
      The default RedHat compiler gcc-2.96 ditributed in RedHat 7.X is NOT
      supported. It has been verified that it produces incorrect binaries,
      therefore is not reliable. See also note below.
  o Windows-2000 and CygWin Tools with: Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 5

Platforms configured but not tested and not supported:
  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027 with/without ObjectSpace STL
  o HP 10.20, aCC C++ B3910B A.01.23 with/without ObjectSpace STL
  o SGI V6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 with ObjectSpace STL
  o AIX 4.3.2, xlC compiler with ObjectSpace STL
  o MacOS 10.1, gcc 2.92.2

2. AIDA and CLHEP
-----------------

Geant4 4.1 requires the installation of CLHEP. 

See <A href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/INSTALLATION/clhep.html">
CLHEP</A>. Tests have been performed with CLHEP 1.7.5.0. However, first
level porting has also been verified on CLHEP 1.8.0.0.

By default, the CLHEP installation scripts will activate ISO/ANSI C++ features
if the compiler is capable. You need to explicitly disable CLHEP settings in
case you wish non-ISO/ANSI setup on specific compilers.

Geant4 4.1 coworks with ANAPHE 4.0.4 and components included therein:
  Objectivity 6.1.3
  HepODBMS 0.3.3.1
  CLHEP 1.7.5.0
  AIDA 2.2

For more information about ANAPHE, see:
  <A href="http://cern.ch/anaphe">ANAPHE</A>

AIDA headers can be downloaded from:
  <A href="http://aida.freehep.org">AIDA</A>


3. The Standard Template Library
--------------------------------

Native versions of STL have been tested on the following platforms:

   Windows/2000, Linux, and SUN.

NOTES:

- Platform specific setup:
  o DEC:   Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup.
  o SUN:   Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup (CC 5.2 only).
  o Linux: Native STL is required (non ISO/ANSI setup for egcs compiler only).
  o W2000: Native STL and ISO/ANSI setup required (VC++ 6.0).
  o MacOS: Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup.


4. Persistency
--------------

  See release notes for Geant4 4.0.


5. Compiler Specific Problems
-----------------------------

  o Linux Red Hat 7.X, gcc-2.96.

    - The default compiler distributed by Red Hat since release 7.0 is
      NOT supported and not considered reliable for running a Geant4-based
      application. In more than one test case, binaries produced by gcc-2.96
      have shown incorrect behavior, either due to wrong order of
      initialisation of static data in memory or to bugs in the system
      iostream classes, problems which apparently have all been solved in
      more recent versions of the compiler (3.X series).
      For seek of knowledge, gcc-2.96 is a compiler that has never been
      officially released, nor supported by the GNU team itself and is not
      considered reliable by the authors (for more information, see also
      http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.96.html).


6. Known Run-Time Problems and Limitations
------------------------------------------

For a complete list of outstanding run-time problems and to submit any
problem you may find running this version of Geant4, please refer to the
Geant4 Problem Reporting System, available on the Web at this address:

    http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cgi-bin/geant4/problemreport


7. Compilation Warnings
-----------------------

There are compilation warnings on some platforms.  We do not believe
that any will lead to incorrect run-time behaviour, but we are working
on reducing them.


8. Known Run-Time Warnings
--------------------------

The following messages can be written to error output while tracking.
We believe none give rise to incorrect behaviour.

  o G4PropagateInField: Warning: Particle is looping 
    -  tracking in field will be stopped. 
       It has performed 10000 steps in Field while a maximum of 10000
       are allowed.
