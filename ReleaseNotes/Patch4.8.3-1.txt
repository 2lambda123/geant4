                 Geant4 8.3 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           17 August 2007

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 8.3:

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + magneticfield:
      o Relaxed 'FatalException' to 'Warning' in method
        G4MagIntegratorDriver::AccurateAdvance() for case of step zero and
        return previous value. This fixes problem observed by ATLAS and CMS
        in release 8.3 when using very conservative values for field
        parameters.
    + solids/specific:
      o Fixes in G4Polyhedra::GetPointOnSurface():
        Correctly treat 'totalPhi' instead of 'endPhi' for the case of open
        shapes and 'twopi' for not open shapes.
        Introduced fix for the case when number of sectors (numSide) is equal
        to 1. At the origin of problems observed when checking overlaps for
        polyhedra solids defined as such.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Changed date for patch-01 to release 8.3.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o Fixed memory leak at initialisation in classes
        G4ElectroNuclearCrossSection and G4PhotoNuclearCrossSection.
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space:
      o Memory leak fix in G4StringChipsParticleLevelInterface,
        G4QuasiFreeRatios and G4QElasticCrossSection.
      o Fixed DB filling (ID update) in G4QuasiFreeRatios, responsible for
        excessive growth of memory in long runs.
    + util:
      o Three bug fixes in G4ReactionDynamics::TwoCluster(): removed a sharp
        peak at 180 degrees by fixing a units error and fixed an error in
        sampling the momentum transfer. Fixed array bound violation which
        caused in some rare occasions an infinite loop.

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + liblist.c: fixed problem affecting recent CygWin installations on
      Windows in parsing the buffer for the generation of libname.map.
    + binmake.gmk: defined OUT internal variable specifying the proper
      compilation/linking option to Unix or Windows compilers: '-o '
      and '/Fe' respectively. Cleared <TAB> characters where not necessary.
    + SUN-CC.gmk: forced -xO2 as optimisation level.
