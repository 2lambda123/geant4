                            Test203
                            -------

  The purpose of this test is to exercise the visualization with a realistic
  detector.

  Uses GAMOS geometry format.  Code and data file by Pedro Arce.
  Data file cmsgeom.txt is a representation of the CMS detector.
  November 2006: Made into geant4/test/test203.  John Allison.

Usage: Interactive mode:
  test203
Then try the following commands:
/vis/open OGLSX 600x600-0+0
#  Create scene which draws to depth 2.
#  Drawing all with "/vis/drawVolume" is too much!
/vis/scene/create
/vis/scene/add/volume OCMS 0 2
/vis/sceneHandler/attach
/vis/viewer/refresh
# At this time, Nov 2006, clearly some problems.
