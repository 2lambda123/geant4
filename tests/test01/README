                            Test01
                            ------

  The purpose of this test is to excersize the geometry extensively, and 
try to validate its jobs.

 To run it you can use

    g4test test01.in

 which will compile, run it and check its output, 
or compile it and say:

./AIX-AFS/test01 < test01.in | tee test01.newout
diff test01.out test01.newout

to run it and check the output yourself.
