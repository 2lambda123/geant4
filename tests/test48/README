NOTE: at this point, it's not even a draft but more like work notes...

This package is intended for comparison of results of the G4 code/models
for stopping particle vs one another, as well as vs experimental data.


For stopping particles, we have "traditional" processes/hadronic/stopping
code and the newer code that's a part of the CHIPS model.
The "traditional" code actually includes two "alternative" models for pi-,
that we would also like to compare vs each other.

We currently use edxperimental data (table) for stopped pi- from this paper:
R.Madey et al., Phys.Rev.C25, 2050 (1982)

For stopped pbar, there's a large volume of materials, incl. from LEAR
(Crystal Barrel), as well as much earlier data from 70's and 80's.
As a starting point we use these 2 reviews:
C. Amsler, Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 1293 (1998)
C. Amsler and F. Myher, Ann. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. 41, 219 (1991)

We also have G4 models for stopped antineutrons and K-, yet we continue
searching for suitable publications and experimental sets for comparison.
At presernt, for antineutrons and K- we will compare only G4 results (CHIPS
or "traditional") vs each other.
