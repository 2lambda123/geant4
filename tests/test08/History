This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

September 31, 98 G.Barrand
- "standardize" the test ; do the prerun in test08.in, 
  regenerate .out on HP-aCC.

17th September 1998 John Apostolakis
- Disabled muon processes (which were not used) to speed up execution.
- Corrected geometry

9th August 1998  John Allison
- Removed trackerChamber_logVisAtt->SetForceWireframe(true);
- Removed G4_SOLVE_TEMPLATES macros (now done in architecture.gmk).
- Change G4UIterminal to G4UIGAG.

16th July 1998  John Allison
- Changed /vis~/Draw... to /vis~/draw.

9th July 1998  John Allison
- Added G4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE and G4VIS_USE_OPENGLWIN32 to T08VisManager.cc.

8th July 1998  G.Cosmo
- Protected visualization code with G4VIS_USE.

6th July 1998  John Allison
- Simplified T08VisManager.

June 29 , 98 H.Kurashige
- Modified T08PhysicsList. 

May   15, 98 G. Cosmo

- Added #ifdef protection to T08MagneticField.hh. Header now
  included explicitly in T08DetectorConstruction.hh. Example now
  links.

May   07, 98 J. Apostolakis

- Created Physical Volume Parameterisation for Tracker Chambers.
- Copied from example6:
       MyTrackerHit into T08TrackerHit

May   05, 98 J. Apostolakis

- Changed the geometry in DetectorConstruction.
- Created the Magnetic Field

May   01, 98 J. Apostolakis

- Files created by copying from exampleEmPhys2, renaming the files 
    and the classes within them, changing the string "My" into 

- Major changes made:
  * Event action: deleted energy counting.


April 09, 98 G. Cosmo

- Created.
