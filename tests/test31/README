                                    GEOMETRY


GammaTherapy application geometry consists of along z:

1. Generator of electrons directed along z-axis
2. Target1 (Be)
3. Target2 (W,Cu)
4. GasVolume (He)
5. CheckVolume (Air) it is sensitive for killing of rest electrons
6. Phantom (H2O)
7. Absorber in Phantom (H2O) it is sensitive for absorbed energy calculation

World volume consists of Air.

Geometry aand otherr parammeters can be defined by G4 UI commands.

Two main macro ffiles be.in (thin taarget) and be_w.in (thick) targeet is provided.

AIDA hhistograms can bee activated by defining environment variable. For example,
using t-shell:

setenv G4ANALYSIS_USE 1
gmake
