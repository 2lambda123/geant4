                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

tests-V03-02-05 19th November 2001  John Allison
- This tag is geant4-04-00-cand-01 plus changes to VisManagers
  for new graphics systems and defaults.

tests-V03-02-03  18th Oct 2001  Steve O'Neale
- update reference outputs in tests directory
- consolidate individual contributions to the test suite

tests-V03-02-01  25th Sep 2001  Steve O'Neale
- update reference outputs in tests directory

tests-V03-02-00  28th Aug 2001  Gabriele Cosmo
- removed obsolete files in directories "results" and "tools"
  and synchronised with CVS head.

tests-V03-00-01  16th Feb 2001  Steve O'Neale 
- consolidate updates for stl migration and new refence outputs

tests-V03-00-00  25th Jan 2001  Steve O'Neale 
- update reference outputs for the monthly reference tag
  There has been considerable work in the EM areas so almost
  every test has at the very least different values for the
  min.delta Energy in solids and   sometimes liquids and gases.
  For the tests printing tracking output there are completely 
  new values. I have the impression from browsing files with
  tkdiff that there are more energy-loss steps and there are
  a few cases where a physics process changes - a change from
  conv to brems changes the output log. 
  There are no identified changes from the geometry tags.

tests-V02-00-07   6th December 2000 Steve O'Neale 
- install large_N reference outputs
 
tests-V02-00-06  18th November 2000 Steve O'Neale 
- update test02.hadron and test17 SUN reference outputs 

tests-V02-00-05  4th November 2000 Steve O'Neale 
- update test outputs for test14 

tests-V02-00-04  28th August 2000 Steve O'Neale 
- update test outputs tags145, and code changes in tests needed 
  for recent EM work

tests-V02-00-02  9th August 2000 Steve O'Neale 
- updated outputs from tests for public patch geant4-02-00
  work on stt scripts will pickup a tag but the "real" versions
  are in a transition phase in testtools.

tests-V01-01-01  3rd May 2000  John Allison
- test14.out updated for em-V01-01-01.
- Changed update.sh for Bonsai.

tests-V01-01-00  2nd May 2000  John Allison
- Corresponds to geant4-01-01-0ref-03.

tests-01-00-03  April 26th 1999  Makoto Asai
- Changed interfaces of user action classes

March 27th 1999  John Allison
- Updated test05.out and test08.out.
- Forced order of x,y,z in Tst10PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc.

February 6th 1999  John Allison
- Commented out troublesome printing:
  - tracking/verbose in various places.
  - run/verbose in some .in files to suppress timing information which
    spoils the diff.

tests-01-00-02  January 28th 1999  John Allison
- Removed `exit' from setup.sh.
- Updated some .in files to reduce output.
- Updated .out files to SUN debug except 05 and 07.

tests-01-00-01  January 20th 1999  John Allison
- First attempt at reworked scripts for new stt structure.

September 10th, 1998 - Gabriele Cosmo
- Added statements to each main() function to define RanecuEngine as
  the default engine.
- Updated the following reference-output files accordingly (run on SUN-AFS):
  test01.geom1.out, test02.EM.out, test02.hadron.out, test03.out, test05.out
  testT07.out.

August 26th, 1998 - John Allison (tests-00-02-01)
- Backed out G4UIGAG as default - G4UIterminal is now default.

14th August 1998  John Allison
- Added checkout.sh and 2 .sdb files.

July 20th 1998 - G.Cosmo (tests-00-01-07)
- Many updates since last _not_ announced tags on test01,02,04,05 and
  new reference output files.

July 8th 1998 - G.Cosmo (tests-00-01-03)
- Created test04 (Y.Morita)
- Added hadronic processes to Tst02PhysicsList.cc in test02 (F.Jones)
- Removed test02.in from test02 (M.Asai)

July 6th 1998 - G.Cosmo (tests-00-01-02)
- Created test01
- Tagged.

July 6th 1998 - G.Cosmo
- Created.
