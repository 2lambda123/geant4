     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                      System Tests module
                      -------------------

This module collects a set of "system" tests which are used as part of the
validation procedure, to verify and control the overall functionalities of
the GEANT4 toolkit.
The system tests must be considered as "global" regression tests aimed to
verify the robustness and reliability of the product in many areas.
Therefore, each test may include more than one test case, covering different
initial conditions and setups. Initial setups for a specific tests are
represented by *.in macros, reference outputs for each test case are
represented by *.out files.
This set of tests is going to be extended in future, to become more and more
exhaustive and complete.
 
test01 ## Geometry - CSG solids and navigator.
       ## (Action? Augment, plus Booleans.)
test02 ## Standard em processes.  Low energy and high energy
       ## hadronic processes and stopping, including coherent
       ## elastic scattering.  (Derived originally from ExN04)
       ## (Action? Split into (a) em, (b) had with higher em cuts)
test05 ## BREPS and STEP Interface.
test06 ## Integral approach electromagnetic processes.  Simple box.
       ## (Action?  Add muon test script)
test07 ## Statistical evaluation prototype.  (Derived originally from ExN03)
test09 ## Basic e.m. processes, Polarised Compton, new photelectric
       ## effect, synchrotron radiation, simple box.
       ## (Action?  Add magnetic field, ElossPLus, muon test script)
test10 ## Uses optical photons to test geometry.
test11 ## Neutron transport.
test12 ## FTF String Model.
test13 ## Dual Parton Model.
test14 ## LowEnergy em (photons and electrons).
test15 ## Isotope Production
test16 ## n and p Cross-Sections
test17 ## LowEnergy em (protons, antiprotons and ions). 
test18 ## Radioactive decay.
test20 ## Polarised LowE processes.
test21 ## CHIPS as intra-nuclear transport replacement.
test22 ## Gamma and electro-nuclear physics.
test23 ## Cut per material and persistency of physics table.
       ## (Action?  Currently not functional, to be migrated to
       ##           cuts-by-region with material parameterisations?)
test24 ## Binary cascade hadronic model.
test25 ## Classical cascade hadronic model.
test26 ## Cuts by region modelling.
test32 ## Leading_particle biasing model of G4Mars5Ge on MARS13.
test33 ## Importance biasing and scoring.
