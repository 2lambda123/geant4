Intermediate energy validation is done by comparing Monte Carlo predictions vs experimental data.

This test consists of 2 parts:

I. We compare Geant4-predicted and experimentally measured inclusive productions of protons and neutrons 
   in the following reactions:
  0) pi+ C at 1.4GeV     4) pi- C  at 5.0GeV     8) p C at 1.4GeV
  1) pi+ U at 1.4GeV     5) pi- Cu at 5.0GeV     9) p U at 1.4GeV
  2) pi+ C at 5.0GeV     6) pi- Pb at 5.0GeV    10) p C at 7.5GeV
  3) pi+ U at 5.0GeV     7) pi- U  at 5.0GeV    11) p U at 7.5GeV
   (so called ITEP test)


II. We compare Geant4-predicted and experimentally measured inclusive production of pi+/-, K+/-, or protons
   in p Be, p Cu, or P Au reactions at 14.6GeV (aka BNL test)

Data are stored in CVS, together with the C++ code of the package, in a form of ASCII tables, under /itep
or /bnl subdirectories.

We are validatng the following Geant4 models: LEP, Bertini, Binary, FTFP, QGSC (except that FTFP and QGSC
are not supposed to run at 1.4GeV, and we do NOT employ then in low energy tests).


Monte Carlo predictions can be obtained by running Geant4-based application, which can be configured at run 
time, to model given number of events (1,000,000 in this case) for a given beam-target combination at a given 
energy, and to employ one or another Geant4 hadronic model, or to execute sequentially several hadronis models.

The outputof a job will be one or several ROOT files (histograms). Each ROOT file will correspond to a given
combination beam-target-energy and a given Geant4 hadronic model.  

To analize the output and to compare predictions of different Geant4 hadronic models (vs experimental data, or
vs each other) we also provide several ROOT scripts (macros), combined in a single script Plot.C, also stored
in CVS as part of the package.

Together with the Geant4 application code and the data tables we store shell run scripts that allow to execute
these tests, either interactively, on in batch, or in a grid-like environment:

-- run_pip_itep.csh will execute either all 4 tests 0)-3), or if given an input argument from 0 through 3, it'll
   execute a given test

-- run_pim_itep.csh will execute either all 4 tests 4)-7), or if given an input argument, will execute selected

-- run_proton_itep.csh will execute all 4 tests 8)-11), or if given an input argument, will run selected 

-- run_bnl.csh - *** DOCS COMING ***
 
Each shell script executes not only Geant4 run, but also analysis step, and delivers comparison plots, in the
encapsulated postscript format (eps).
