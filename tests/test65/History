- CMakeLists.txt : Add ExternalProject for downloading LEND data as
  part of test build. It currently uses the URL provided on the Geant4
  website. The test65-data target provided by the ExternalProject_Add
  call is added as a dependency of the main test65 target to ensure
  the data is created before the executable.
