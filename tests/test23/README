                                 Test23
                                 ------

Description:  test made by Mikhail Kossov for debugging and testing of the
              nuclear capture process G4QCaptureAtRest for nine (9) particles,
              which can be captured by nuclei:
              1. Well measured pi-, K- antiProton and antiNeutron capture (4)
              2. Negative hyperon capture Sigma-, Xi-, Omega-, antiSigma+ (4)
              3. Muon- capture at rest                                    (1)
                                                                          ---
                                                                          (9)

              Other hadronic processes are included, as implemented by the
              LEP and HEP models.

              Electromagnetic processes are included, but are mostly turned
              off by setting production threshold to 1 m. 


Usage:        auto-generated file provides input for 1 MeV mu- incident on 
              aluminum.  1000 events are run.  An option exists to run 100,000
              mu- on Pb.

              Verbose atepping action available but not currently used.


Running:      Build both test23 and test23_hadronic_exerciser.
              Then generate the input file:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test23_hadronic_exerciser >& test23.in &
              for the 10 event test, or

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test23_hadronic_exerciser large_N > & test23_large_N.in &
              for the 200 event test.

              Then run the test:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test23 test23.in >& test23.out &


Type of test: run to completion


Output:       run log
              numbers of particles produced
              mean energies of produced particle types
