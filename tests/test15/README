                                 Test15
                                 ------

Description:  This is a test of the G4NeutronIsotopeProduction model.  All
              electromagnetic, hadronic and decay processes are included.  Most
              electromagnetic models are essentially turned off by setting the
              production threshold to 1 m.
              The LEP and HEP hadronic models are used, as well as the 
              G4NeutronIsotopeProduction model which is assigned to neutrons. 
              Generic (default) isotope production is turned on for protons.
              The detector is a simple box of air, aluminum, lead or uranium.
         
Usage:        An auto-generated file provides input for proton runs with incident 
              energy of 10 GeV for each material.  There are 4 runs in all, with
              10 or optionally, 200 events per run.

Running:      Build both test15 and test15_hadronic_exerciser.
              Then generate the input file:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test15_hadronic_exerciser >& test15.in &
              for the 10 event test, or

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test15_hadronic_exerciser large_N > & test15_large_N.in &
              for the 200 event test.

              Then run the test:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test15 test15.in >& test15.out &


Type of test: run to completion

Output:       run log
