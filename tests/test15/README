                                 Test15
                                 ------

Description:  test of the G4NeutronIsotopeProduction model.
              All electromagnetic, hadronic and decay processes are included.
              Most electromagnetic models are essentially turned off by setting 
              the production threshold to 1 m.
              The LEP and HEP hadronic models are used, as well as the 
              G4NeutronIsotopeProduction model which is assigned to neutrons. 

              Detector is a simple box of air, aluminum, lead or uranium.
         
Usage:        auto-generated file provides input for proton runs with incident 
              energy of 10 GeV for each material.
              4 runs in all, with 10 or optionally, 200 events per run.

              Verbose atepping action available but not currently
              used.


Running:      Build both test15 and test15_hadronic_exerciser.
              Then generate the input file:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test15_hadronic_exerciser >& test15.in &
              for the 10 event test, or

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test15_hadronic_exerciser large_N > & test15_large_N.in &
              for the 200 event test.

              Then run the test:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test15 test15.in >& test15.out &


Type of test: run to completion

Output:       run log
