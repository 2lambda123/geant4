Aug. 19th, 2002 M. Dressel - test33-V05-02-00
  - test for weight window technique

Apr  9th, 2003  M. Dressel - test33-V05-00-03
  - use geometries with a deeper structure to test the parallel
    transport and the G4IStore in a more challenging way

Mar 12, 2003  John Allison - test33-V05-00-02
- Added HepRep to vis manager.

Mar 11th, 2003  M. Dressel - test33-V05-00-01
  - change the replicanumber of the world volume from -1 to 0

Feb 19th, 2003  G. Cosmo - test33-V05-00-00
  - Removed redundant inclusion of PhysicalConstants.h.
    Now using CLHEP headers.

Dec 06th, 2002  G. Cosmo test33-V04-01-05
  - Merged changes in messenger for migration to new G4ApplicationState.
  - Corrected GNUmakefile.

Nov 29th, 2002  M. Dressel test33-V04-01-04
  - remove src/G4Trajectory.cc and added a DrawTrajectory function
    in Tst33VisEventAction
  - some changes dut to gcc-3.2 complains.

Nov 25th, 2002  M. Dressel test33-V04-01-03
  added src/G4Trajectory.cc.

Nov 23th, 2002  M. Dressel 
  change of parallel geometry 

Nov 22th, 2002  M. Dressel 
  changed geometry for scoring. Cells must not coinside with
  wolrd boundary since tracks would be killed before
  scoring is called in the case a track exits a cell into
  "out of world".


Nov, 20th 2002 M.Dressel  (test33-V04-01-02)
- some code cleanup
- added some comments to the header files
- removed some old files

Nov, 4th 2002 M.Dressel  (test33-V04-01-01)
- remove G4std:: where it does not belong to
- replace str() functions

Oct 29, 2002 - M.Dressel  (test33-V04-01-00)
- first implementation

Oct 29, 2002 - M.Dressel
- first implementation

Oct 29, 2002 - M.Dressel
- added DISCLAIMERs

Oct 25, 2002 - G.Cosmo
- Created.
