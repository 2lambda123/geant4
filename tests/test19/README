test19
======================================================================

System test for the energy dependence of the process level simulation

Authors: Mikhail Kosov

======================================================================

---- Status: Beta version

---- Input file: chipstest.in

---- Output: screan or chip_{name}.log in the subdirectory made by kumac
---- Output ntuples: tuple3pi.out, tuplevta.out, tuplevtq.out, tuplincl.out

---- Location of the reference output: any name defined after >

---- Macros: no macros

---- Other files required: no additional files

---- How to run it?
     > cd test19
     [ edit the test19.cc file. If "#define nout" is uncommented, then the ]
     [ resulting executable is not providing the output files for PAW.  ]  
     > make  (compile the cc files and make the executable)
     > ln -s ../../bin/Linux-g++/test19 test19 (ore another path)
     > test19 (uses internally chipstest.in file, switch of the output)
     {> test19 test19.in >& result.out (not implemented yet)}
     {> test19 test19.large_N.in >& result.large_N.out (not yet)}
     ==>>: Before the simulation of pictures, comment "#define nout" in
     ==>>: the test19.cc file and recompile test19 (> make)
     > cd {subdirectory}
     > ls *.kumac
     name1.kumac ... nemeI.kumac (not all kumac's are working, see below)
     > paw
     paw >> exe nameI {param1 {param2...} usually param1=f, nEv=f*2000
     ----- test19 start working using chipstest_nucleus.in files --------
     ----- the last picture (usually the only picture) is on the screan -
     paw >> pict/list
     PICT1
     ...
     PICTI
     paw >> pict/plot PICTI (just to look on the picture I)
     paw >> meta 10 -113 (after that all pictures are stored to paw.metafile)
     paw >> pict/plot PICTI (put picture I in the paw.metafile as eps)
     paw >> exit (quit does not save the paw.metafile correctly!)
     > mv paw.metafile nucleus.eps

Directories:

  gamma
  -----
     gamma62.kumac makes simulation for Ca40, uses chipstest_ca2020.in
     .......       param1=nEvent/2000 (D=1), nEvent=numberOfSimulatedEvents

     gamma100.kumac makes simulation for C12, uses chipstest_c0606.in
     ........      param1 = energy in MeV (123/default and 151 are possible)
                   param2 = nEvent/2000, nEvent(default=3) in one Run
                   param3 = nRun(default=3) = number of runs
                   statistics is subdivided in runs to avoid overflow of files
  photon
  ------
     only photon.kumac simulates Li7, Be9, C12, O16, Al27, Ca40 in GDR region
          ......   uses corresponding chipsterst_nucleus.in files
                   param1 = nEvent/2000 (default 0.1)
