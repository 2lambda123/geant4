        --------------------

An idiosyncratic collection of volumes placed here and there.  It
shows up some vis problems and some tracking problems.

// Usage: test202 [macro-file]
// Typically: test202  (executes vis.mac and enters interactive session)
//        or: test202 run0.mac (executes run0.mac, enters interactive session)
//
// Note: Type of session determined by G4UI_USE... macros.  The first
// found is instantiated (see test202.cc code).

A) test202
   This executes vis.mac and enters an interactive session.  It simply
   displays a selection of volumes using OpenGL.

B) test202 runN.mac, where N = 0,1,2,...
   This executes runN.mac and enters an interactive session.  The runN
   macros vary the volume selection and shoot some particles to
   demonstrate some problems.  Consult the comment lines of the
   individual macros for explanations.

NOTE : 

There is a visualisation test associate with this macro. On 28th May 2014, the only test run with OGLIX.mac.
This macro file with generate some pictures and the test script xvfb.sh will compare produced pictures to a
reference folder OGLIX-reference.
In order to generate a new reference file, the best way is to :
- 1. do some changes in OGLIX.mac
- 2. produce eps files on the tested machine (Nightly builds for example)
- 3. get theses files from OGLIX-output and copy them into OGLIX-reference folder
- 3. OR send theses files by email (that's what is done on 28th May 2014)
