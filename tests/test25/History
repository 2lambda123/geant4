21st March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo (test25-V06-00-01)
- Removed -pg compilation option in GNUmakefile which was most probably
  originally introduced and forgotten...
  It was causing profile build to be triggered and, as side effect,
  confusing the output generated with Valgrind !

19th March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo (test25-V06-00-00)
- Fixed definition of materials and values in messenger.
- Made test25.in be the default input script.

16th March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo
- Fixed compilation warnings.
- Replaced usage of NULL with 0.

7th November 2002  Hans-Peter Wellisch
- Created the test.
