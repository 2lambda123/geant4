This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

26 Feb 2013 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-06-01
- Reduced the number of events from 100 to 80 to avoid timeout errors.

10 Jan 2013 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-06-00
- Increased the time limit to avoid timeout errors.

13 Nov 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-09
- Fixed the massive non-reproducibility in Windows due to use of
  a Unix command (mv) in the script reproducibility.py .

11 Oct 2012 Gabriele Cosmo               test68-V09-05-08
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

11 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-07
- Fixed compilation warning in Windows (<ctime>, std::time).

10 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-06
- Use $<CONFIGURATION> (instead of hardwired "RelWithDebInfo")
  to get the subdirectory where the executable is placed in Windows.

10 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-05
- Fix bad output format: it could fix the non-reproducibility
  seen in both Mac and Windows.

10 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-04
- Try to fix the problem on Windows by specifying explicitly the
  path and name of the executable invoked by the Python script.

05 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-03
- Moved from "Experimental" group to "Nightly" and "Continuous".
  Increased the number of events from 10 to 100.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-02
- Fixed small mistake.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-01
- Can be built with CMake and ready for CTest.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-00
- Created new test for the reproducibility of FTFP_BERT.
  In this first version, only GNUmakefile (no CMake), and the
  tests are steered by a shell script (not working on Windows),
  which calls a Python script (also not working on Windows).
