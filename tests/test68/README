Description:    reproducibility tests of FTFP_BERT.
                It does 10 checks of reproducibility for each
                of the following 5 cases of single hadrons
                impinging on a simplified calorimeter:
                  1.  20 GeV  kaon0L  on  Fe-Sci
                  2.  20 GeV  pion-   on  Cu-LAr
                  3.  20 GeV  neutron on  Pb-Sci
                  4.  20 GeV  proton  on  W-LAr
                  5.  20 GeV  kaon-   on  PbWO4

Type of test:   run to completion

Output:         run log
