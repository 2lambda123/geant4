                            test40
                            -------

     This test is cloned from TestEm2 in order to perform benchmarking
     TestEm2 allows to do the shower development of an single primary
     particle, and to survey the physics processes which occur,
     with printing and visualization.

     test40 inteded to control the performance for the setup with
     10 radiation length absorber. The mean trancated energy deposited
     in the absorber is compeared with the precalculated one. If
     the deviation is less than 3 sigma the test result "is accepted"
     unless "is not accepted".
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
     The geometry consists of a cylinder of homegenous material.
     This cylinder is replicated longitudinaly (slice) and radialy (ring).
  
     The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
     but all of the above parameters can be modified interactively via
     the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.
  
     Material can be choosen: Air Water lAr Al Fe BGO PbWO4 Pb.
      
     The size of the slices and rings are expressed in radiation length units
     and can be changed.
      
     An uniform magnetic field along the cylinder axis can be set.
     
 2- PHYSICS LISTS

    Physics Lists are subdivided on 4 following modules:
    1. "particles" - particle definitions  
    2. "general" - decays and transportation  
    3. "standard" (alternative) - standard EM physics
    4. "model"    (alternative) - standard EM physics using model approach
      	    
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
     The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
     cylinder perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
     and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
     changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see
     the macros provided with this example).
 	
     A RUN is a set of events.
 					  	
 4- HOW TO START ?
 
     - compile and link to generate an executable
 		% cd test40
 		% gmake
 		
     - execute test40 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		% test40 test40.in
 		
     - execute test40 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 		% test40
 		....
 		Idle> type your commands
  		....
 		Idle> exit
 	
 5- HISTOGRAMS
 
     test40 can produce several histo which are saved as test40.paw
     
     Content of these histo:
  
      1 : energy deposit       per event
      2 : charged track length per event
      3 : neutral track length per event
            
      4 : longitudinal energy profile
      5 : cumulated longitudinal energy profile
      6 : rms of cumulated longitudinal energy profile
      
      7 : gamma's flux
      8 : positron's flux
      9 : electron's flux
                      
     10 : radial energy profile    
     11 : cumulated radial energy profile
     12 : rms of cumulated radial energy profile

 Note that histograms are disabled via the flag G4NOHIST in the GNUmakefile.
