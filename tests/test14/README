                            Test14
                            ------

Modular PhysicsLists for verious families of electron/photon processes

How to run
----------

test14 < test14_lowE.in		LowE processes based on EEDL and EPDL for
				electrons/photons, standard processes for e+

test14 < test14_std.in		standard processes

test14 < test14_penelope.in     LowE processes based on EEDL for electrons,
                                Penelope processes for photons, 
                                standard processes for e+

test14 < test14_polarised.in    LowE processes based on EEDL for electrons,
                                LowE polarised processes for photons, 
                                standard processes for e+

Same for *.large_N.in           High statistics runs
