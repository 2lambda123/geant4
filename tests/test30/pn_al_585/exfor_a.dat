METHOD     (EXTB,SITA,BCINT)
           THE BEAM CURRENT WAS MEASURED EXTERNALLY USING A
           SECONDARY EMISSION CHAMBER (SEE G.W.TAUTFEST ET AL.,
           REV.SCI.INSTR.26,229(1955)) THROUGH WHICH THE BEAM
           TRAVERSED BEFORE HITTING THE TARGET.
           THIS CHAMBER WAS CALIBRATED BEFOR EACH IRRADIATION BY
           COMPARISON WITH AN IONIZATION CHAMBER. THE SENSITIVITY
           WAS FOUND TO BE CONSTANT WITHIN 2 PER CENT.

DETECTOR   (GEMUC)
           THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY WAS DETERMINED BY CALIBRATION
           WITH NA-24 STANDARD SOURCES
COMMENT    THE F-18 CROSS SECTION WAS A BY-PRODUCT OF THE ACCURATE
           NA-24 CROSS SECTION DETERMINATION AND WAS OBTAINED
           FROM THE SAME IRRADIATIONS (SEE SUBENTRY B0094002).
SAMPLE     AL-FOILS, THICKNESS 10 MG/CM**2 +-0.5 PER CENT
           DETERMINED BY ABSORPTION MEASUREMENT AND WEIGHING,
           PURITY 99.99 PER CENT
ERR-ANALYS THE ERROR IS ONLY 3 PER CENT RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE
           NA-24 CROSS SECTION WHICH HAS AN ACCURACY OF 5 PER
           CENT OR 0.5 MB (SEE B0094002)

           The Realative Efficiency Calibration and
           Inhomogeneities of Target Thickness. Its do not
           Consider Those Errors Which Systematically Affect All
           The Samples in the Same Way Such As Absolute Efficiency
           Calibration, Absolute Flux Determination, and Errors of
           Monitor Cross Sections. The Overall Error of the Latter
           Effects is About 7%. It has to be Quadratically Added
           To Those Quoted If Absolute Errors are Required For
           Comparison with the Results of Other Authors.
