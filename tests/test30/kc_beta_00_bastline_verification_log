Vladimir: Check pn_be_585 to make sure the data are ok.

Vladimir: pn_zr_800 to make sure the data are ok.



logs for kc_beta_baseline_0:
pn_al_022 - evaporation neutrons missing.
pn_al_039 - norm uncertain.
pn_al_090 - test is wrong -- Vladimir to check
pn_al_113 - somewhat too much backward
pn_al_160 - somewhat too much backward, or maybe not
pn_al_256 - dito
pn_al_585 - warning particle may be looping, and negative excitation energies
          - do we decay short-lived particles at the end?
	  - pions look glorious -- why ? do higher statistics.
pn_al_800 - seems ok.
pn_be_113 - ! no evaporation neutrons below 5 Mev ! ==> change excitationHandler
pn_be_256 - no evap, but quasi-elastic peak looks marvelous
pn_be_585 - perfect, but ! pion normalization is off !
pn_be_800 - ????? crash ??????

*** G4Exception: Aborting execution ***
Abort
pn_fe_022 - confused energy distributions
pn_fe_065 - hangs right away.
pn_fe_113 - good, but too much backward -- too much energy in pre-equ decay?
pn_fe_256 - peaks are glorious !!!! use these plots. (too much backward)
pn_fe_597 - peak again beautyful !!! use these plots.
pn_fe_800 - forward angles perfect, backwrds angles: too few high energy neutrons
pn_fe_pb_065 - empty.
pn_ni_200 - ==> do not touch, is the high stat run is still on the way.
pn_ni_585 - ==> Pions look like worth running with higher statistics.
pn_pb_035 - looks good.
pn_pb_065 - ==> looping right away ????
pn_pb_120 - ==> semi-infinite loop; too much in precompound.
pn_pb_160 - peak is missing somewhat in strength, too much backward - we are entering semi-infinite loops
pn_pb_256 - may be too much backward - we are entering semi-infinite loops
pn_pb_597 - 30deg perfect, 60 perfect, 120 almost there, 150 lowish
          - pions: very nice ==> worth running with higher statistics.
pn_pb_800 - too low by one order of magnitude ????
pn_zr_022 - too flat, as all the 22MeV data.
pn_zr_035 - shape ok, but too many neutrons.
pn_zr_050 - seems ok, but needs more stats to say anything.
pn_zr_120 - peak (0, 11, 24, etc. degrees) is ok.
          - 82 degrees and above is too high.
pn_zr_160 - brief looping breaks, peak ok, too much backward (>=106 degrees)
pn_zr_256 - peak nice, second angle: simulation too low.
pn_zr_800 - too little in the quasi-elastic peak, otherwise ok-ish
