- Ready to be proposed for testing, for the first time.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-01
- Can be built with CMake and ready for CTest.
  However, it creates too many tests, so it needs to be improved.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-00
- Created a new test for BERT and FTFP nuclear capture at rest.
  In this first version, only GNUmakefile (no CMake), and the
  tests are steered by a shell script (not working on Windows).
