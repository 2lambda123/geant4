Description:    test of BERT and FTFP for nuclear capture at rest.
                BERT is used for pi-, k-, and sigma-.
                FTFP is used for anti_proton, and anti_sigma+.
                The following 9 materials are tested: 
                G4_Be, G4_He, G4_C, G4_Al, G4_Ar, G4_Fe, G4_Cu, G4_W, G4_Pb.

Type of test:   run to completion

Output:         run log
