                                     Test16
                                     ------

Description:  test of n and p cross sections in the classes
              G4NeutronInelasticCrossSection and G4ProtonInelasticCrossSection 
              using the LEP and HEP models.  All electromagnetic, hadronic and
              decay processes are included.  For hadrons other than n and p, 
              the default LHEP cross sections are used.
 
              Detector is a simple box of air, aluminum or lead.


Usage:        auto-generated file provides input for neutron and proton runs 
              with incident energies of 1, 10 and 20 GeV for each material.
              18 runs in all, with the 10 events per run.  

              Verbose atepping action available but not currently 
              used.


Running:      Build both test16 and test16_hadronic_exerciser.
              Then generate the input file:

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test16_hadronic_exerciser >& test16.in &

              and run the test:
  
              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test16 test16.in >& test16.out &
 

Type of test: run to completion


Output:       run log
