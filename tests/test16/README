                                     Test16
                                     ------

Description:  test of n and p cross sections in the classes
              G4NeutronInelasticCrossSection and G4ProtonInelasticCrossSection 
              using the LEP and HEP models.  All electromagnetic, hadronic and
              decay processes are included.  For hadrons other than n and p, 
              the default LHEP cross sections are used.
 
              Detector is a simple box of air, aluminum or lead.


Usage:        auto-generated file provides input for neutron and proton runs 
              with incident energies of 1, 10 and 20 GeV for each material.
              18 runs in all, with the 10 events per run.  

              Verbose atepping action available but not currently 
              used.

Building:     This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
              testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
              mode.  To do that you must:

              1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                 directory

              2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                 stand-alone one:

                 mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                 mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

              3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                 and Geant4 version 9.6:

                 rm test16
                 rm test16_hadronic_exerciser
                 setenv G4INSTALL /location_of_geant4/geant4-install/
                 cmake -DGeant4_DIR=$G4INSTALL/lib64/Geant4-9.6.0/ 

              4. Build both test16 and test16_hadronic_exerciser:

                 make -jN -f Makefile 
                 
Running:      First generate the input file:

                 ./test16_hadronic_exerciser >& test16.in &

              Set the environment variables G4LEDATA and G4LEVELGAMMADATA to
              point to the EM and nuclear data files:

                 setenv G4LEDATA /path_to_file/G4EMLOW6.32
                 setenv G4LEVELGAMMADATA /path_to_file/PhotonEvaporation2.3

              where G4EMLOW6.32 and PhotonEvaporation2.3 are the latest versions
              of the data files at this release.
 
              Finally, run the test:
  
                 ./test16 test16.in >& test16.out &
 

Type of test: run to completion


Output:       run log
