                    Test 69 History file
                    --------------------
This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

     ----------------------------------------------------------

21 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-10)
- Reduce the number of shots to 1000 (avoids timeout in boundscheck build).

18 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-09)
- Force number of threads using envvar (necessary to avoid out-of-memory errors
  on MTmax builds).
- Fix a compilation warning.

17 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-06, -07, -08)
- Suppress some leftover debug statements.
- Add some debug statements (so much for nothing).
- Compile and run the tests even if ROOT is not found.
- Suppress the step limiter; should no longer be needed.

15 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-05)
- Add a step limiter (minimum KinE=1 MeV). This should prevent timeouts in
  tests with *_HP physics lists.

9 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-04)
- Resize the target to 20x20x20 cm^3.
- Revert the number of shots to 2500 for the normal physics lists and 100 for
  the *_HP physics lists.
- Don't hard-code the number of threads, let the macros set it.

8 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-03)
- Reduce number of shots to 1000 for the normal physics lists and 10 for the
  *_HP physics lists.
- Increase timeout to 1 h for FTFP_INCLXX_ABLA.

7 July 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-01, -02)
- Add possibility to tally the INCL++ reactions. The tallies are disabled by
  default and are controlled by the TEST69_TALLY envvar. A G4analysis-based
  tally and a ROOT-based tally are available. The ROOT tally is more
  sophisticated, but it requires ROOT (duh).
- Adjust the abundances of the mixed material so that the mean free path is
  roughly the same for all component nuclei.
- Fix README file.
- Fix coupling to ABLA -- previously only the first INCL++ model in the
  G4HadronicInteractionRegistry was actually coupled to ABLA.

16 May 2014, Davide Mancusi (test69-V10-00-00)
- Extend test timeout to 1 hour.

12 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-10)
- Remove the quick-and-dirty fix for Windows crash, the problem (?) was in
  G4INCLXXInterfaceStore.

12 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-09)
- Quick-and-dirty fix for Windows crash.

7 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-08)
- Limit number of threads for HP-based tests.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-07)
- Fix the path to the macro for the INCLXX/ABLA test

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-06)
- Activate the INCLXX/ABLA test.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-05)
- Shorten tests with NeutronHP-based physics lists.
- Add a test for INCLXX/ABLA.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-04)
- Nothing new, just resubmit the tag.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-03)
- Overhaul of test69.
- Add "mix" material, which should help with exercising different sectors of
  the physics list.
- Reduce the number of test cases to 2:
  o 40-GeV p + mix
  o 12-GeV C12 + mix
- Add the possibility to test different physics lists via an envvar.
- Define unit tests for all the INCLXX-based physics lists.
- Add visualisation and UIExecutive in interactive mode.

21 May 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-01,test69-V09-06-02)
- Fix: test69 was actually NOT testing the reactions due to particles being
  prematurely killed.
- Add definition for Li detector material.
- Revise macros.

13 May 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-00)
- Migration to MT.
- Suppress unused user stepping action.

11 October 2012, Gabriele Cosmo (test69-V09-05-02)
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

14 September 2012, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-05-01)
- Move all macro files in a dedicated directory.

14 September 2012, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-05-00)
- Split big test69 into many small tests, so that it can be run in parallel.
- Updated README.

26 October 2011, Pekka Kaitaniemi (test69-V09-04-00)
- Created a new test for INCL++ cascade model.
- Requires INCL++ tag hadr-inclxx-V09-04-03 or later.
