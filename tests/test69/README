                            Test69
                            ------

Geant4 system test for the INCL++ cascade model and the INCLXX-based physics lists.

Test configurations:

40-GeV p + mixed material
12-GeV C12 + mixed material

The material is a mixture of H, He, C, Si, Cu, Pb and U, with weight fractions
proportional to A^(1/3). That should yield roughly the same mean free path for
inelastic collisions of high-energy particles on all the components.

The physics list to test is controlled by the TEST69_PHYSLIST envvar. Just set
it to the name of whatever physics list you want to test.

Coupling INCL++ with ABLA can be requested by defining the TEST69_USE_ABLA
envvar.

test69 can also produce ROOT files with histograms (and, optionally, ntuples)
of the reactions treated by INCL++. Set the TEST69_TALLY envvar to "analysis"
to use the G4Analysis-based tally, or to "root" to use the ROOT-based tally
(does not produce any histogram, but rather a comprehensive ntuple).
