G4USE_HEPODBMS
In Geant4, object persistency is provided as an optional category, so
that the users could be able to run Geant4 with or without a commercial 
ODBMS package. How to store and retrieve Geant4 events, hits and geometry 
objects is explained in documentation.

For setting this you should have an ODMG compliant database
(e.g. Objectivity/DB) installed and running on your system!
