                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarise all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

- U/g4_10_gdml.U: Added new unit to configure variables for new GDML module.
By default it does not activate the module, and prompts user for activation
It probes for the existence of XercesC headers (no lib checks) and then
prompts user for path to install if it doesn't find xercesc.
- config/scripts/*.SH: Added new entries to set G4LIB_BUILD_GDML and
XERCESCROOT. XERCESCROOT/lib is also appended to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH if user chose to build the GDML module.
