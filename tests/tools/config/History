                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarise all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

28th November 2007 Ben Morgan
- Configure: Regenerated for addition of Qt UI and VIS modules.
- config/scripts/*.SH: Added setting of Qt UI and VIS environment variables to
install, move and env .SH scripts, in line with how other variables from these
categorys are set.
- U/g4_10_gdml.U: Dependency on g4_09_vis_qt.U added so that units sort
correctly.
- U/g4_09_vis_qt.U: NEW FILE, adds query/probe of OpenGL Qt vis driver. Only
performed for Linux-g++ and Darwin-g++ systems. If module is enabled,
autoprobe for Qt4 is performed if q4_qthome variable is null. This may have
been set earlier by the Qt4 UI module. Failure of any autoprobe tests results
in user being queried by Qt4 installation path, with checks being done on this
to confirm Qt4 installation.


27th November 2007 Ben Morgan
- U/g4_05_shared.U, U/g4_08_ui.U: Dependencies added to MAKE lines in these
unit files to ensure they get correctly sorted in Configure script. Adding the
Qt UI unit file broke (for unknown reasons) the correct ordering of units.
- U/g4_08_ui_qt.U: NEW FILE, adds query/probe of Qt based UI module. Only
performed for Linux-g++ and Darwin-g++ systems. If module is enabled,
autoprobe for Qt4 is performed, and failur of any of these checks results in
user being queried for Qt install location. Sets three variables for use in
.Sh files - g4ui_build_qt_session, g4ui_use_qt and g4_qthome.



20th November 2007 Ben Morgan
- U/g4_10_gdml.U: Added a filter so that if root of xercesc install is
/usr or /usr/local, g4gdml_xercesc_root and hence XERCESCROOT will be set
to "". Done to give (partially) cleaner additions to compile commands.

20th November 2007 Ben Morgan
- U/g4_03_dirs_data.U: Updated neutron cross sections data to G4NDL3.12.


13th November 2007 Ben Morgan
- U/g4_10_gdml.U: Added new unit to configure variables for new GDML module.
By default it does not activate the module, and prompts user for activation
It probes for the existence of XercesC headers (no lib checks) and then
prompts user for path to install if it doesn't find xercesc.
- config/scripts/*.SH: Added new entries to set G4LIB_BUILD_GDML and
XERCESCROOT. XERCESCROOT/lib is also appended to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH if user chose to build the GDML module.


12th November 2007 Ben Morgan
- U/g4_03_dirs_data.U: Updated G4EMLOW to 5.1, and added internal variable
g4abladata for new ABLA dataset.
- config/scripts/env.csh.SH: Added entry to set G4ABLADATA variable
- config/scripts/env.sh.SH: Added entry to set G4ABLADATA variable
- config/scripts/install.sh.SH: Added entry to set G4ABLADATA variable
- config/scripts/move.sh.SH: Added entry to set G4ABLADATA variable

- Oldconfig.U: 
		a) it was introduced distinguishing for 'egcs' and 'g++'
		b) 

- Oldconfig.U
