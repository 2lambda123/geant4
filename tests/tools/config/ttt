Checking echo to see how to suppress newlines...
...using -n.
The star should be here-->*

Beginning of configuration questions for g4conf.

Would you like to see the instructions? [n]

Locating common programs...
awk is in /usr/bin/awk.
cat is in /bin/cat.
expr is in /usr/bin/expr.
rm is in /bin/rm.
sed is in /bin/sed.
touch is in /bin/touch.
tr is in /usr/bin/tr.

Don't worry if any of the following aren't found...
date is in /bin/date.
ln is in /bin/ln.
test is in /usr/bin/test.
uname is in /bin/uname.
Using the test built into your sh.

Symbolic links are supported.

Good, your tr supports [:lower:] and [:upper:] to convert case.

ls: *.sh: No such file or directory

You may give one or more space-separated answers, or "none" if appropriate.
If your OS version has no hints, DO NOT give a wrong version -- say "none".

Which of these apply, if any? [none]



We should now define G4SYSTEM. It's combined from
your OS system name and compiler used: Linux-g++.

1) OS           : Linux

2) Compiler     : g++

Select from list above (e.g. 2)
[Press [Enter] for setting default answers and next configuration screen]

OK, your 'G4SYSTEM' will be Linux-g++.

I see a config.sh file.  Shall I use it to set the defaults? [n]
OK, I'll ignore it.

I can set things up so that your shell scripts and binaries are more portable,
at what may be a noticable cost in performance.  In particular, if you
ask to be portable, the following happens:

     1) Shell scripts will rely on the PATH variable rather than using
        the paths derived above.
     2) ~username interpretations will be done at run time rather than
        by Configure.

Do you expect to run these scripts and binaries on multiple machines? [n]

Do you want to set DEBUG flag? [n]



Do you want to build 'global' libraries? [n]






The default libraries are archive (static) libraries.

Do you want to build 'shared' libraries?
[n]



Do you want to use 'granular' libraries? [n]



We should now define G4USE_OSPACE and OSPACE_BASE_DIR.

1) G4USE_OSPACE:        [NOT DEFINED]   (toggle by selection!)

2) OSPACE_BASE_DIR:

Select from list above (e.g. 2)
[Press [Enter] for setting default answers and next configuration screen]

End of configuration questions.


Creating config.sh...

If you'd like to make any changes to the config.sh file before I begin
to configure things, do it as a shell escape now (e.g. !vi config.sh).

Press return or use a shell escape to edit config.sh:
