  I put some number of the disk usage
 for some STT machines.
  The below numbers show huge differences
 between at least HP/aCC and OSF1/cxx. It could
 be fine to have numbers for other platforms to 
 help evaluate disk needs, 

  All number are in M bytes.
 bin coresspond to test01, 02, 03, 05, 07, 08, 10
 lib = archives + shlibs.

 source 24

aleph.lal.in2p3.fr, HP-UX, aCC :
 lib 261
 bin  71
 tmp 278
 -------
     610

asc.lal.in2p3.fr, OSF1, cxx :
 lib  58
 bin  58
 tmp  62
 -------
     178
 
 For asc.lal.in2p3.fr and aleph.lal.in2p3.fr
 the sources are shared. Then :
   geant4beta + HP-aCC + OSF1 = 894

PC-Barrand.lal.in2p3.fr, NT 4.0, VC 5.0 :
 lib  79
 bin  19
 -------
      98
