 setup.csh :
 ---------
  A file that you source to set up the environment.
 It defines also some aliases like :
    g4make
    g4build
    g4tail
    g4filter
 to spawn a reconstruction and analyse log files.

  setup.csh calls specific.csh. This files
 is dedicated for stt members customisation.
 it uses `uname -n` to execute stt specific things.

 build.sh :
 -------- 
  This script spawn the reconstruction of libraries
 from $G4INSTALL/tests/tools/bin directory. The output of the job
 is put in $G4WORKDIR/stt/$G4SYSTEM/gmake.log.
  Aliases g4tail, g4log, defined by the setup.csh(.sh) file
 permits to follow the job, and to filter output.

  Usage :
     UNIX> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
     UNIX> chmod u+x build.sh
     UNIX> ./build.sh all
     UNIX> ./build.sh lib all
     UNIX> ./build.sh lib <category>
     UNIX> ./build.sh test all
     UNIX> ./build.sh test <test>
     UNIX> ./build.sh run
  The last command spawn tests.

 filter.sh :
 ---------
  This script takes a gmake.log file
 produced by a reconstruction. It filters
 this file by removing lines found in 
 file in a specific .filter file.

 Usage :
     UNIX> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
     UNIX> chmod u+x filter.sh
     UNIX> ./filter.sh OSF1
 or :
       csh> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
       csh> source setup.csh
       csh> g4filter

  Then you have to provide a :
       tests/tools/bin/<g4system>.filter
 corresponding to your g4system(s).
 In it you put part of the lines that 
 you don't want to appear in the filtered 
 output. See OSF1.filter and HP-aCC.filter
 output. 


 summary :
 -------
  Then mainly with these files, to reconstruct
 for example the libs and survey without aliases :
   UNIX> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
   UNIX> ./build.sh lib all
   UNIX> tail -f $G4WORKDIR/stt/$G4SYSTEM/gmake.log
   UNIX> ./filter.sh $G4SYSTEM

  In csh with setup file, to spwan reconstruction 
 of lib and tests programs do :
    csh> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
    csh> source setup.csh
    csh> g4build all
 and to survey do :
    csh> g4tail
    csh> g4filter
