                            Test11
                            ------

Description:  neutron transport test using LEP and 
              the HP (High Precision including Thermal Scattering) models.
              The detector is a simple box made up of air, aluminum, lead 
              or uranium.

Type of test: run to completion

Building:     This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
              testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
              mode.  To do that you must:

              1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                 directory

              2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                 stand-alone one:

                 mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                 mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

              3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                 and Geant4 version 9.6:

                 rm test11
                 cmake .

              4. Build test11:

                 make -f Makefile 
 
Running:      First, generate the input file

                 ./test11_hadronic_exerciser large_N > & test11.largeN.in &

              which sets the number of events per run to 20.  Without the 
              large_N argument there is only one event per run.

              Finally, run the test

                 ./test11 test11.largeN.in >& test11.out &

Output:       run log
