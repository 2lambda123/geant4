                            Test18
                            ------

Description:   test of radioactive decay for 1 MeV incident ions.
               Decay of ions Na24, Ne24, F9, Al24, Cr46 and Po215

Type of test:  run to completion

Building:      This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
               testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
               mode.  To do that you must:

               1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                  directory

               2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                  stand-alone one:

                  mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                  mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

               3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                  and Geant4 version 9.6:

                  rm test18
                  cmake .

              4. Build test18:

                 make -f Makefile 
                 
Running:

              Finally, run the short test:

                 ./test18 test18.in >& test18.out &

              This throws one event per run.  For the long test, which throws
              1000 events per run, do 

                 ./test18 test18.large_N.in >& test18.out &

Output:       run log (verbosity 1)
