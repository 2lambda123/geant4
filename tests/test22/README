                                 Test22
                                 ------
Description:  cross-section scaling test of electro-nuclear reactions, and
              test of interface to the Chiral Invariant Phase Space model for
              high energy gamma interactions.

              All electromagnetic processes are included in this test, with
              the addition of G4ElectronNuclearProcess, G4PositronNuclearProcess,
              and G4PhotoNuclearProcess.

              The electro-nuclear reaction cross section is scaled up by a
              factor of 1000.  The positron and gamma processes are not scaled.

              G4PhotoNuclearProcess is implemented by the G4GammaNuclearReaction
              model below 3.5 GeV and by the interface to the Chiral Invariant
              Phase Space model between 3 GeV and 100 TeV.

              A complete set of hadronic processes, implemented by the LEP and
              HEP models, is also included.

              Detector is a simple box of air, aluminum or lead.


Usage:        input file specifies 100 GeV gamma incident on aluminum target
              and 100 GeV electron incident on air.  2 runs of 5 events each,
              or optionally 25 events each.  

              Verbose stepping action available but not currently
              used.


Running:      Build test22 and run

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test22 test22.in >& test22.out &
              for 5 events per run, or

              ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/test22 test22.large_N.in >& test22.out &


Type of test: run to completion


Output:       run log
