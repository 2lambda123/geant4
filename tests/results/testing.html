<a NAME="SystemTesting"></a>System Testing</h1>
A System Test Team was established following agreement at the Niigata Workshop
in July 1998.&nbsp; Its members are:
<blockquote>John Allison, (Manchester, BaBar) Coordinator (<a href="mailto:John.Allison@man.ac.uk">John.Allison@man.ac.uk</a>)
<br>Guy Barrand (IN2P3, ATLAS/BaBar) (<a href="mailto:barrand@lal.in2p3.fr">barrand@lal.in2p3.fr</a>)
<br>Frank Behner (Zurich, CMS) (<a href="mailto:Frank.Behner@cern.ch">Frank.Behner@cern.ch</a>)
<br>Ryosuke Hamatsu (Tokyo Metr.) (<a href="mailto:hamatsu@comp.metro-u.ac.jp">hamatsu@comp.metro-u.ac.jp</a>)
<br>Fred Jones (TRIUMF) (<a href="mailto:fwj@Triumf.CA">fwj@Triumf.CA</a>)
<br>Stefano Magni (INFN, Borex) (<a href="mailto:magni@mi.infn.it">magni@mi.infn.it</a>)
<br>Serguei Sadilov (IHEP,Protvino) (<a href="mailto:Serguei.Sadilov@cern.ch">Serguei.Sadilov@cern.ch</a>)</blockquote>
and they can be mailed collectively on <a href="mailto:geant4-stt@listbox.cern.ch">geant4-stt@listbox.cern.ch</a>.
<p>At our inaugural meeting we agreed (more or less!) the following, some
of which places new requirements on the category coordinators.
<p>Bugs will be "tracked", i.e., recorded and logged.
<p>One thing we agreed was that it is <i>highly desirable </i>to avoid
new features in the 2 weeks up to a public release.&nbsp; Ideally, those
two weeks are reserved for bug fixing.&nbsp; There is a trade-off between
having new features and having reliable code; the feeling was that we must
move to higher reliability.
<h2>
Our Aim</h2>
To improve the quality and robustness of GEANT4 code at the "System Level",
that is to say, to ensure it compiles and runs without crashing on all
supported platforms in tests wich cover a wide range of physics, geometries,
particles, processes over many events.&nbsp; Although physics validation
is not our aim, we will obviously be aware of the physics quality and seek
cooperation with the category teams.
<h2>
<a NAME="Assumptions"></a>Our Assumptions and Requirements.</h2>
During normal development, tags will be tested and simply accepted or rejected
- we call this <b>incremental acceptance</b>.&nbsp; Two weeks before a
public release we go into the <b>release phase</b> - see below.
<ul>
<li>
We assume that code tagged and announced for System Testing has already
been subject to Unit Testing by the category working group.</li>

<li>
We will encourage a steady improvement of Unit tests, e.g., to cover more
platforms.</li>

<li>
When a category team want to include new code in the next release they
should make a tag and inform the System Test Team.</li>

<li>
We encourage an early announcement of tags, so that tests can be spread
over time, and <i>discourage</i> last minute tags.</li>

<li>
Each tag will be subject to tests and accepted or rejected on a short timescale
- 2 working days.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If accepted, it will become part of the "reference" version, and category
coordinators will be asked to make a formal announcement of the tag on
the Tags Blackboard.</li>

<li>
If rejected, a new category tag will be requested which fixes the problem(s).</li>
</ul>
This is the <b>incremental acceptance phase.</b>
<li>
Accepted tags will be tagged with a global tag from time to time for the
convenience of developers.</li>

<li>
Two weeks before a release, <i>no new category tags will be accepted.</i>&nbsp;
The existing accepted tags will form the basis of the release.&nbsp; A
CVS branch will be created, if required, on which e<i>ssential </i>bug
fixes can be made.&nbsp; This is the <b>release phase.</b></li>

<li>
We will feed problems back to category coordinators and expect an 24 hour
acknowledgement and reasonable urgency to fix.</li>

<li>
We have the right to exclude code from a release if it causes problems.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
Communicating&nbsp; "Incidents" to Category Coordinators</h1>
For each Test Incident, i.e., for each problem or bug, the STT member should
make a Test Incident Report as follows.&nbsp; He/she should:
<ul>
<li>
describe the problem in a text file or html file.&nbsp; There is a template
in geant4/tests/results/TIR_template.txt.</li>

<li>
mail the category coordinator of the category in which the problem first
appears and copy to geant4-stt@listbox.cern.ch (see geant4/tests/responsibles
for a list of coordinators and associates - include the associates if it
seems reasonable).</li>

<li>
checkout/update geant4/tests/results/TIR_summary.html, add an entry, with
a hyperlink to the text file or the html file, then commit.&nbsp; The text
file or html file describing the report can also be comitted to an appropriate
results/ sub-directory or placed under your own web server.</li>

<li>
<b>during the incremental acceptance phase, </b>ask the category coordinator
to fix the problem and submit a new category tag.&nbsp; If the new tag
fixes the problem, checkout/update geant4/tests/results/TIR_summary.html
again and mark the TIR as "fixed", and ask the category coordinator to
make a formal announcement of the tag on the Tags Blackboard.</li>

<li>
<b>during the release phase, if new problems arise, </b>ask the category
coordinator to fix the problem on the branch and, if appropriate, also
in the main trunk.&nbsp; On hearing from the category coordinator or his/her
associate to the effect that fixes have been made, checkout/update geant4/tests/results/TIR_summary.html
again and mark the TIR as "fixed".&nbsp; (Problems not fixed will be listed
in the Release Notes.)</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a NAME="TestSuite"></a>Test Suite</h1>
<a href="restricted/geant4/tests/results/test_suite.html">A set of tests
in geant4/tests/</a> excercises the code.&nbsp; These will be continually
enhanced.&nbsp; <a href="../../G4UsersDocuments/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/PracticalApplications/exampleCodes.html">The
examples under geant4/examples/</a> are also tested.
<h1>
<a NAME="TIRs"></a>Test Incident Reports</h1>
These are currently <a href="restricted/geant4/tests/results/TIR_summary.html">logged
</a>in
a simple fashion for members of the System Test Team.
<h1>
<a NAME="Procedures"></a>Test Procedures</h1>
There are detailed <a href="restricted/geant4/tests/results/procedures.html">test
procedures </a>for members of the System Test Team.
<h1>
<a NAME="Database"></a>Tags Database</h1>
Category tags are notified and recorded in a <a href="restricted/geant4/tests/results/tags_database.html#ActiveTable">database</a>,
tested then accepted or rejected according to the above <a href="restricted/geant4/tests/results/procedures.html">procedures</a>.
<h1>
<a NAME="ReleasePolicy"></a>Release Policy</h1>
Hopefully, the above policies will mean that we go into the release phase
with no outstanding problems.&nbsp; However, some new problems might emerge
during the porting of the code on all supported platforms/compilers.&nbsp;
There might also be some agreed "deferred" problems.&nbsp; If these cannot
be fixed, and are not killers, they should be listed in the Release Notes.
<p>We have agreed that the normal policy for making a System Test or Public
Release is to make a CVS branch (see also <a href="tag_release_policy.html">Tag
and Release Policy)</a>.&nbsp; Testers - including Category Testers - will
have to checkout the branch into a separate working directory so as to
avoid confusion with the main trunk (development) version.&nbsp; The branch
will then be used for testing and any bugs found will have to be fixed
there and, if appropriate, also in the development version.&nbsp; This
will be done primarily by the Category Testers in response to TIRs.
<p>A CVS branch behaves like an independent version of the code.&nbsp;
This means that developers are free to continue developing. The down side
is that System and Category Testers have to check out an independent version
of the code in a separate working so that essential bugs (ESSENTIAL bugs
only) can be fixed on the branch (and also be fixed in the HEAD if appropriate).&nbsp;
But we have discussed this and we think it is an acceptable price to pay
for giving us the freedom to patch releases and continue development.
