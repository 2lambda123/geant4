  o moved all shapes which are non-pure CSG to solids/specific.
    See related History files for more details.
  o moved unit-tests to appropriate test directories.
  o extracted tests "SBT" and "Fred" and placed one level up in
    solids/tests (new directory).
- Fixes to G4Tubes.cc and G4Hype[.hh.cc].
- Added new shape in solids/specific: G4EllipticalTube.
- Organised class description comments for the Software Reference Manual
  in CSG and specific headers. Added CVS headers to files in specific.
