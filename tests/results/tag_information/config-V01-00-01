- Added control for the Ray-tracer driver. Introduced
  G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER in G4VIS_USE.gmk and
  G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER in G4VIS_BUILD.gmk (M.Asai).
- binmake.gmk: fixed dependency order for compound libraries.
  Moved -lG4particles and -lG4materials downstream in the list.
- architecture.gmk: added G4NO_OPTIMISE for allowing compilation
  without any level of optimisation or debug. G4DEBUG if defined
  takes precedence. G4DEBUG and G4OPTIMISE are now defined also as
  CPPFLAGS.
