 Dear colleagues,

 config-01-00-03 adds several new features to the previous tag, among
 all the ability to automatically build granular libraries (type
 "gmake" from geant4/source). "gmake global" is still the valid
 command for building compound libraries as before.
 Tested on DEC-cxx and HP-aCC.
 Below follows the complete list of changes since the previous tag.
 Please, include this tag in your tests.

                        Gabriele

 BTW - This tag coworks with the HEAD of source/GNUmakefile. Please,
       update that file as well !

>From History file:

19th April 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-01-00-03)
- architecture.gmk: introduced CCFLAGS for all platforms. Set CCFLAGS
  to "-Ae +DAportable" for HP-aCC to overcome compilation problems on
  liblist.c

18th April 1999  Youhei Morita
- architecture.gmk, binmake.gmk: introduced OBJY_LDLIB variable for
  defining Objectivity library within G4ODBMS.

13th April 1999  Gabriele Cosmo
- architecture.gmk: added the following options in compilation:
  o HP-aCC, SGI-CC: +Onolimit, -Olimit 5000 respectively.
    Not suppress any optimization specifying a high or unlimited
    memory limitation.
  o DEC-cxx: -timplicit_local.
    Get rid of the template repository by generating explicit template
    instantiations used in the code with internal linkage.
    
13th April 1999  John Allison
- In binmake.gmk: - moved libmap target to source/GNUmakefile.
                  - extensive tidying.

12th April 1999  John Allison
- In liblist.c:  - fixed bug to distinguish, e.g., track from tracking.
                 - improved printing.
                 - improved "Usage" comments.
                 - improved protection against bad input format.
- In binmake.gmk, used $(ECHO) to solve platform dependency of echo.
- In binmake.gmk for granular libraries:
   - fully implemented -d option.
   - Gave /tmp files a unique name.
   - Removed repeated libraries - no longer necessary, all circular
       dependencies seem solved.

9th April 1999  Frank Behner
- Fixed bug in liblist in -d option
- Changed binmake.gmk to use liblist -d

18th February 1999  John Allison
- Added G4USE_STL flag.
- Added code for linking granular libraries.
