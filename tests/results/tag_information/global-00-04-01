- Removed G4Allocator.cc containing all template declarations for
  GNU-g++ compiler not supported anymore.
- Removed g4templates.hh contining all template declarations for the
  old DEC cxx 5.X compiler not supported anymore.
- Moved G4ParticleTypes.hh to particles/management/include to remove
  dependency over particles category.
- Updated management/GNUmakefile: not anymore dependencies over
  external categories. Dependency over intercoms to be fixed still.

 I tested this tag on DEC-cxx based on:
    beta03-ref-01  +  intercoms-00-04-02

 I committed on the HEAD the following _needed_ fixes:
 - processes/hadronic/stopping/src/G4StopDummyDeexcitation.cc
   (removed useless (!?) inclusion of g4templates.hh)
 - particles/management/include/G4ParticleTypes.hh
   (moved from global/management/include)

 This tag requires a full compilation _from scratch_ !
 Please, consider this tag for your tests.
