Some class names have changed:

  G4VBarion            has been changed to G4VBaryon
  G4VBarionConstructor has been changed to G4BaryonConstructor

and the library libG4barions has been renamed to libG4baryons.

Note that for the time being subdirectory names remain unchanged,
e.g., particles/hadrons/barions.

********** REQUIRED CHANGE  ************************************

This REQUIRES changes in some PhysicsLists.  The changes in examples
and tests have already been made and are included in this tag.  But in
your own PhysicsList you might require the following change:

  G4BarionConstructor pConstructor;
  pConstructor.ConstructParticle();

should become:

  G4BaryonConstructor pConstructor;
  pConstructor.ConstructParticle();

Also you will need to remake the library map.  In geant4/source:

  gmake

but you probably will have done this anyway.

*********** END OF REQUIRED CHANGE ******************************

*********** OPTIONAL CHANGES ******************************

You might also like to change some internally used names.  E.g., in
exampleN02 the following changes, although not strictly necessary,
have also been made:

In .hh, change:
  virtual void ConstructBarions();
to:
  virtual void ConstructBaryons();

In .cc, change:
  ConstructBarions();
to: 
  ConstructBaryons();
and:
  void ExN02PhysicsList::ConstructBarions()
to:
  void ExN02PhysicsList::ConstructBaryons()

*********** END OF OPTIONAL CHANGES ******************************
