                 Problems with geant4-01-00-ref-07
                 =================================

The situation has changed little since geant4-01-00-ref-06.

The following problems are fixed:

  DEC: optim: T05 STEP reader crash.

Problems still with us:

  Everywhere: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
  NON-ISO:    Linux: optim: N04.EMtest: 10000 steps warnings.
              SUN: optim: T14 differences.
  ISO:        T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.
              DEC: optim: T02.hadron loop/crash.
  Large N:    See below.

The following new problem arose:

  Linux debug N04: G4PropagatorInField::LocateIntersectionPoint.


Summary
=======

NON-ISO
-------

DEC: debug: NON-ISO: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
     optim: NON-ISO: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.

HP: debug: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
    optim: ditto.

Linux: debug: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
              N04: G4PropagatorInField::LocateIntersectionPoint (see below).
       optim: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
              N04.EMtest: 10000 steps warnings.

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
     optim: NON-ISO: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T14 differences (the only case where optim differs
                     from debug!).

ISO
---

DEC: debug:     ISO: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.
     optim:     ISO: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T02.hadron loop/crash.
                     T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.

NT: debug: ISO: T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.
              
SUN: debug:     ISO: Compiles, unresolved template references at linking. 
     optim:     ISO: Loops during compilation of G4ChargedGeantino.cc.


Previous "large-N" problems still remaining
===========================================

1) test15: grows large (memory leak?)

2) (probably) N04.EMtest: loop on Linux in optimised mode with large
    number of events.


Details of new problem
----------------------

Linux debug N04:
G4PropagatorInField::LocateIntersectionPoint:   Warning: Integration inaccuracy requires 
 an adjustment in the step's endpoint 
   Two mid-points are further apart than their curve length difference
   Dist = 9.70332 curve length = 9.70332
