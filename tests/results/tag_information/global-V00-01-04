The update of G4cout and G4cerr is
implemented in the following tag.


config-V00-01-04       - Removed G4STREAM and
                         G4STREAM_STREAMBUF_IMPLEMENTATION. 
                       - Augmented liblist.
global-V00-01-04       - Removed G4STREAM implementation from G4ios and
                         G4strstreambuf.


The former version of G4cout consisted of two
parts; one using strstreambuf and another using streambuf.
The env variable  G4STREAM_STREAMBUF_IMPLEMENTATION was
necessary to distinguish two implementations.
(In addition, AIX required G4STREAM variable.)

The one using strstreambuf is limited by the
available memory of the system. It gave
impression of memory leakage for users who
wants to redirect a large volume of
text outputs.

The revised one adopts only the streambuf implementation with a small
modification for GUI interfaces.
Now, a large text file can be output by
redirection without the memory limit.
The env variable  G4STREAM_STREAMBUF_IMPLEMENTATION
is no more required. GUIs can be used as before.

The function of redirection of a stream from
one session to another is supported in the
new version, too.
