- architecture.gmk: G4USE_OSPACE setup is now independent from
  G4USE_STL which is now devoted for generic STL setup. Added
  -DOS_NO_TYPEDEF_5 option to HP-aCC for ObjectSpace.
 
12th May 1999  Gabriele Cosmo
- architecture.gmk: modified path to STL wrapper files directory to
  point to $RWINC/wrappers/$G4SYSTEM. Wrappers are now differenciated
  according to the architecture type.

- architecture.gmk: merged Isidro's OSPACE setup for HP-aCC.
  Reorganised OSPACE options by introducing OSPACEINC variable.
