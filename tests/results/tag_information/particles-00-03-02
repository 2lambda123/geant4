  1) New classes are added in shortlived category to create higher excited meson
     states. ( tag particles-00-03-01 includes excited baryons)
  2) Rule for particle encoding is modified in order to assign encoding to
higher
     excited meson states.
  3) G4VDecayChannel and G4PhaseSpaceDecayChannel are modified to accept
four-bodys decay.
