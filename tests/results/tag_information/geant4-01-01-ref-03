                       geant4-01-01-ref-03
                       ===================

The reference tag "geant4-01-01-ref-03" is now available.
This is the tag recommended as most up-to-date for Geant4 members. 
It includes all tested fixes, and those developments that have
been tested and have passed our testing procedure.
Libraries and all examples and tests have been built successfully on
the supported platforms as part of the testing cycle.
In addition, validation tests have been built and run successfully
on DEC-cxx (non ISO setup) and HP-aCC (with native STL).

Please see below for details of the most relevant fixes
included in this 'development-release'.

The next recommended reference tag is scheduled for May 26th.

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last
recommended reference tag are:
    - major restructure of geometry/solids/CSG module.
      Created new module solids/specific for generic shapes.
    - new developments in low-energy electromagnetic processes.
    - ability to visualise Boolean solids through G4Polyhedron
      objects.
A more complete list is available below.


How to update a development tree
--------------------------------

Access to the Geant4 CVS repository is required in order to update
a source code directory of Geant4. If you maintain such a development
tree to update it you should do the following:

 cd $G4INSTALL
 cvs update -r geant4-01-01-ref-03 -d -P

For developers only:
 |    You will need an extract step in order to update the tree of
 |  the category that you develop.  Assuming that your developments
 |  are in the head of CVS, you should do the following:
 |
 |      cd <your-(sub)category>
 |      cvs update -d -P -A
 |
 |  Then you'll need to resolve any clashes you may get.

Please, note that due to a directory reorganisation in the geometry
module, it is recommended to remove the old installations completely
before triggering the compilation, i.e.:

  cd $G4INSTALL/source
  gmake clean_all  <-- removes lib bin tmp directories from $G4INSTALL/
  gmake


---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:

config
------
- Added path to new geometry modue geometry/solids/specific.
- Updated filtering script for STEP files g4step_correct.pl.

hadronics
---------
- hadronic/models/neutron_hp: bug-fixes and improvements concerning
  Q-values on Lithium-6, gamma production on Iron56, and triton
  production on B-10.

electromagnetic processes
-------------------------
- Low-energies processes:
  o modifications for integration of cross sections, corrections of
    fluorescence transition probabilities to take into account
    non-radiative transitions.
  o fixes in G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung for continuous energy loss.
  o updated system test test14 and extended-example testem6.

geometry
--------
- magneticfield:
  o corrected signature to function DumbStepper() in classes:
    G4HelixExplicitEuler, G4HelixHeum, G4HelixImplicitEuler,
    G4HelixSimpleRunge and G4MagHelicalStepper.
  o corrected signature and implementation of function
    MagFieldEvaluate() in G4MagHelicalStepper, to use Field (as
    ThreeVector) in place of dydx.
  o made Richardson extrapolation optional in G4MagHelicalStepper.
  o updated unit test testPropagateMagField and reference output.
  o fix in G4LineSection to prevent divisions by 0 and sqrt(<0).
- management:
  o design change in G4VSolid, changed pure virtual method
    G4VSolid::GetExtent() to virtual. Added default implementation
    based on CalculateExtent().
- solids:
  o fixes to G4Tubes and G4Hype.
  o removed implementations of GetExtent() in most sub-classes
    of G4VSolid.
  o fixed implementations of visualization utility method
    DescribeYourselfTo().
  o restructured CSG directory and created new module solids/specific.
  o added new shape in solids/specific: G4EllipticalTube.
  o created new directory solids/test and moved test suites "SBT"
    and "Fred" therein.
- solids/Boolean:
  o CreatePolyhedron implemented for BooleanSolids.
  o G4DisplacedSolid: reversed implementation of GetFrameRotation and
    GetObjectRotation, removing inappropriate invertion.
  o G4DisplacedSolid::GetConstituentMovedSolid() made const.

visualization
-------------
- Added ability to visualise boolean solids through G4Polyhedron
  objects:
  o Made G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid() virtual. No longer
    deals with composite solids - now programmed into
    CompositeSolid::CreatePolyhedron().
  o G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid() no longer deals with
    displaced solids - now programmed into
    G4DisplacedSolid::CreatePolyhedron().
  o Added G4LogicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid(), which explicitly adds
    components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.
  o Removed unnecessary #includes from G4VSceneHandler.hh.
