 I made available new tags for testing of geometry/solids/BREPS and
 geometry/solids/STEPinterface. These new tags include changes for
 decoupling BREPS from the STEP (STEP reader) module. A dependency
 which needs to be evaluated carefully is still present and documented
 in the History file. Please, see below the extract from the History
 files. Tested on SUN-CC.

+++ BREPS +++ breps-V00-01-00

- First step for decoupling BREPS from NIST STEP reader:
   - Moved G4NISTStepReader[.hh.cc] and G4StepFileReader[.hh] to
     STEPinterface.
   - Removed unused references to STEP in G4KnotVector and G4PointRat.
   >> Still remaining: reference to STEPaggregate in G4PointRat;
                       reference to instMgr in G4BREPSolid.cc.

+++ STEPinterface +++ stepinterface-V00-01-00

- Added files G4NISTStepReader[.hh.cc] and G4StepFileReader[.hh]
  from BREPS.
- Added inclusion of STEPcomplex.h in G4BoundedSurfaceCreator.cc,
  G4GeometryCreator.cc and G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator.cc.
