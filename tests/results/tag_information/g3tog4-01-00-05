This tag is now available. A node tree is set to to defer logical volume
creation and placement until call list file reading is completed. They
are instantiated in G3toG4BuildTree. The top-level volume is no longer
required to be the first logical volume in the call list file. The
actual methods to handle deferred /divided volumes have not yet been
implemented.

The code compiles without any error messages on Sun and HP.  The only RW
classes in use are RWCStrring, RWTPtrHashDictionary and
RWTPtrOrderedVector. clGeometry, the test example with visualization,
has been successfully run on both platforms.
