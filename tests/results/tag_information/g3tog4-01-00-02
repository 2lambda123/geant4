The material/mixtures handling in G3toG4 has been updated to create
materials and mixtures in the Geant4 paradigm (based on elements). I
provided some updated examples from bbsim's SVT geometry (svt.dat and
svtwaf.dat). The code has been tested on SunOS at SLAC and
hpplus at CERN. The good news is that I can track without bombing
through the full SVT geometry, including support elements made up of
G4Polycones and G4Polyhedra.  The (somewhat) bad news is that it takes
quite awhile to close the geometry, although the situation is now much
better than it was a few months ago.

I've also updated the clGeometry example (based on N03) to display tracks.
At some point, when all the features of G3toG4 are working, clGeometry
should be migrated to the examples/novice area.

As far as divisions is concerned, I've temporarily disabled them until
I've had a chance to review and update the algorithms.
