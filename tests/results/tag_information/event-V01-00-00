---------------

The modifications are the following.

- G4EventManager becomes a singleton, so that classes rather than G4RunManager
 can get the pointer to G4EventManager without accessing to G4RunManager.
- G4EventManager keeps the pointers of all the user action classes except user
 run action.

These modifications are introduced because G4RayTracer needs to have its own
event loop without accessing to G4RunManager. Accessing from G4RayTracer to
G4RunManager violates the use dependency between run and visualization categories.
Also G4RayTracer needs to have its own tracking action and stepping action.
Thus G4RayTracer stores the user's action classes and sets its own classes while
ray tracing is going.

 At the same tag a minor correction for the null pointer protection is applied
for G4StackManager. The same corrections for G4TrackingManager and 
G4SteppingManager will be done by Takashi. He will commit them and tag within a
couple of weeks or so. These corrections are not so serious for the user (I hope), 
and they need not to go in a correction patch, but they are needed for introducing 
G4RayTracer.
