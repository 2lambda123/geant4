                  geant4-01-01-ref-05
                  ===================

This is a "convenience" tag for the use of testing and release
procedures.  Roughly speaking it is geant4-01-01-ref-04 plus Group 1
(low-level category) tags, plus other tags that were thought useful to
include.

geant4-01-01-ref-05 is geant4-01-01-ref-04 plus:

tag:         config-V01-01-04
description:
Added radiative_decay path to binmake.gmk.


tag:         examples-V01-01-04
description:
N02 and N06.out changes for CLHEP 5.

tag:         geometry-V01-01-03
description:
Groups field-V01-01-03, geomvol-V01-01-00, geom-solids-csg-V01-01-02.
- magneticfield (field-V01-01-03):
  o fixes to G4MagErrorStepper (check on chord endpoint),
    G4RKG3_Stepper (deleted error message from StepNoErr),
    G4MagIntegratorDriver (modified debug information).
  o minor fix to dummy implementation of assignment operator
    in G4MagneticField.hh.
  o modified method for finding new trial step in G4ChordFinder.
- volumes (geomvol-V01-01-00):
  o introduced kCarTolerance for check over taken step length and
    TruePathLength in G4PropagatorInField::ComputeStep().
- solids/CSG (geom-solids-csg-V01-01-02):
  o fixes in DistanceToIn(p,v) for G4Box and G4Trd to return 0 distance
    in case computed value is less than 0.5*kCarTolerance.

tag:         geom-solids-csg-V01-01-03
description:
Fix to G4Tubs::DistanceToOut(p,v,...)
- G4Tubs.cc:
  o introduced fix in DistanceToOut(p,v,...) in computation of xi, yi for
    (sphi >= -0.5*kCarTolerance). This fixes problem reports #76 and #91.
  o added more diagnostics in case of invalid enum for DistanceToOut.
- Updated unit test for G4Tubs.

             same as emlowen-V01-01-08, with modifications by V.L. for
             first implementation of continuous energy loss in 
             G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung

tag:         transport-V01-01-01
description:
Corrects the material for Parameterised volumes that parameterise
the material.  (In this case after PostStep of Transportation, the
PreStepPoint could have an incorrect material.)

Co-works with latest track tag, track-V01-01-01, which it requires.

description:
June 2, 2000 M.Asai  (track-V01-01-02)
- Add G4VUserTrackInformation class and its pointer data member in G4Track
- Add "const" to pointer to G4Step in G4Track (Hisaya) 

this tag co-works with tracking-V01-01-01 and transport-V01-01-01

tag:         tracking-V01-01-01
description:
- Add SetUserTrackInformation(G4VUserTrackInformation*) to
 G4TrackingManager (Makoto)
- Fix problems in deleteing Touchable in G4SteppingManager (Hisaya)

/vis/viewer/reset

2nd May 2000  John Allison  vis-V01-01-02
- Added /vis/viewer/reset.
- G4VSceneHandler, G4VViewer, G4OpenGLXmMainMenubarCallbacks: corrected
  some name anomolies - "scene" was still being used in places where it
  meant "scene handler".
- G4VViewer: added GetShortName(), corrected SetName(...).
- G4ViewParameters.hh: improved class description.
- G4VisManager: added ViewerShortName(...) and GetViewer(...) utilities.
- G4RayTracer: set out-of-world ray to black.
- G4RayTracerViewer: corrected trapping of orthogonal projection.
- Some minor enhancements to tests.

27th April 2000  Gabriele Cosmo
- Removed unnecessary #include "G4Transform.hh" from VRML.  (Since
  geometry-V01-01-02 G4Transform.hh no longer exists.)
