- Improved overall diagnostics.
- Fixed internal memory-leaks.
- Added protections for NULL pointers generated by missing geometry
  creators.

- G4AdvancedFaceCreator.cc, G4EdgeLoopCreator.cc
  o added check over the number of allocated curves for composition.
- G4ClosedShellCreator.cc
  o added check over the number of allocated surfaces for composition.
- G4BSplineSurfaceWithKnotsCreator.cc
  o created object is now a G4BSplineSurface. No G4 object was
    returned before.
- G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator[.hh.cc]:
  o fixed bound-overflow problem on array of placements.
  o implemented temporary solution for association of placements and
    manifolded solids for advanced BREP shape representations.
  o added protections for NULL pointers.
- G4GeometryTable.cc:
  o added extra-debug verbosity protected by G4_STEPINTERFACE_DEBUG
    flag.
- G4AssemblyCreator.cc:
  o STEPfile_id is now retrieved through direct call to STEP reader
    function GetApplication_instance(keyw, index).
  o added extra-debug verbosity protected by G4_STEPINTERFACE_DEBUG
    flag.
  o added protection for NULL pointers.
- test/GNUmakefile:
  o moved to use granular libraries.

- Code migrated to handle new NIST STEP Reader SCL 3.2.
- Reduced inter-class dependencies by reorganising include statements
  and removing unnecessary ones.
- Added standard class header description and CVS identifiers.
- Code porting to supported UNIX platforms/compilers.
