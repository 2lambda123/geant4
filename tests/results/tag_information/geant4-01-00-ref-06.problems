                 Problems with geant4-01-00-ref-06
                 =================================

The situation has changed little since geant4-01-00-ref-05.

The following problems have been fixed:
  T14 ISO compliance.

The "large N" problem in test15 on Sun cannot be reproduced, but, as
on Linux, it grows large.

On Windows NT, TestEm4 did not compile and other TestEmx jobs crashed.


Summary
=======

DEC: debug:     ISO: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.
            NON-ISO: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
     optim:     ISO: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T02.hadron loop/crash.
                     T05 STEP reader crash.
                     T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.
            NON-ISO: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T05 STEP reader crash.

HP: debug: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
    optim: ditto.

Linux: debug: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
       optim: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
              N04.EMtest: 10000 steps warnings.

NT: debug: ISO: T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.
              
SUN: debug:     ISO: Compiles, unresolved template references at linking. 
            NON-ISO: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
     optim:     ISO: Loops during compilation of G4ChargedGeantino.cc.
            NON-ISO: N02 G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.
                     T14 differences (the only case where optim differs
                     from debug!).


Previous "large-N" problems still remaining, probably:
======================================================

1) N04.EMtest: loop on Linux in optimised mode with large number of events.

2) test15: grows large (memory leak?)


Report from Gonzalo Gracia on Tests on Windows NT
================================================

SUMMARY
=======

  COMPILING LIBRARIES: -------------------------------------------------------

    No errors.
    Some warnings which were already there for the release:

    Too long symbols for debugger
    Warning C4786: "_________________" identifier was truncated to '255' characters in the debug information

    warning: `MAXNAMLEN' redefined

 COMPILING/LINKING EXAMPLES & TEST ---------------------------------------------

    Additional Warning when linking some tests:
    warning: `_SC_CLK_TCK' redefined

  RUNNING EXAMPLES  -----------------------------------------------------------

    They all run normally


  RUNNING TESTS  -------------------------------------------------------------

    Most of them run normally and giving the reference output

    EXAMPLES 11 and 15 stop with ABNORMAL TERMINATION  (as in cand03)
