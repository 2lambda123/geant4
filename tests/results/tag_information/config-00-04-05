- architecture.gmk: introduced -fnonstd compiler option for SUN-CC.
  This option causes non-standard initialization of floating-point
  arithmetic hardware; it enables hardware traps for floating-point
  overflow, division by zero, and invalid operation exceptions.

- architecture.gmk: corrected paths for HepVis and HepInventor.
- interactivity.gmk: fixed setup for LOAD_IV.

- Revision to make compilation of DAWN (network) driver 
  at Solaris and IRIX automatic. See below.
- Added the following line to SUN-CC and SGI-CC
  CPPFLAGS += -DSOCKET_IRIX_SOLARIS
- Added -L/usr/lib -lsocket -lnsl  in X11LIBS for SUN-CC.

 The new option introduced to SUN-CC architectures might impact
 your tests. I would propose to have this check enabled by default
 in order to easily catch FPEs or invalid operations at run-time.

 NOTE that since tag config-00-04-03 all tests/examples main files
 need to be modified to take into account the removal of the file
 g4templates.hh !
