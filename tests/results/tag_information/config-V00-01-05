- binmake.gmk: added path to HEPNumerics/include which was missing.
- architecture.gmk, interactivity.gmk: introduced
  "G4_OPACS_WIDGET_SET lesstif" logic to handle the case
  of using, on Linux, the bugged lesstif with the non bugged OPACS.
- Introduced fixes for shared library setup. Modified files:
  architecture.gmk, common.gmk, globlib.gmk, makeshlib.sh.
