The following tag: g3tog4-01-00-03 has been tested on HP-aCC and Sun-CC:

1. rztog4 has been updated to generate G4gsmixt call list instruction
when a G3 mixture is encountered.

2. When a G4gsmixt instruction is encountered, a G4 material will be
built from the component elements.

3. References to RWGDlist class  have been replaced with
G4RWTPtrOrderedVector in most (but not yet all) methods.

4. The code to handle G3 divisions has been temporarily disabled until
the algorithms can be updated.

There will be another tag available shortly in which all RWGDlist
occuarances are removed.
