                 Problems with geant4-01-01-ref-04
                 =================================

Same as geant4-01-01-ref-03, namely:
------------------------------------

All platforms: N02: G4ParticleChangeForMSC::CheckIt.

All ISO modes: T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.

DEC: optim: NON-ISO: T02.hadron, T11:  G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the
                                       energy deposit  is negative  !! (see
                                       geant4-01-01-ref-02 problems for
                                       details.)
                ISO: T02.hadron: as NON-ISO.


Large N problems:
-----------------

Conducted only on Sun and Linux.  Note that the problem with T02 in
"SUN: debug: NON-ISO" prevented other tests, possibly masking other
problems.

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: T02 loops - grows to 90+MB after an hour or so, then
                     stable for at least 100 hours.
     optim: NON-ISO: T09: theListOfSecondaries is not empty.
            NON-ISO: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit
                          is negative!!

Linux: debug: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
       optim: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
