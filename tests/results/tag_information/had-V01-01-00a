Notes on the had-V01-01-00a tag:

Some bug fixes; new functionality was added as needed by 
users. Please see below for the details:

hadronic/util:
changes in G4ReactionDynamics to adapt to the memory management policy
of
G4FastVector; Fix of memory-leak (array size information was not
deleted)

hadronic/stopping:
no change

hadronic/management:
Fix of memory-leak (array size information was not deleted).; Changes in 
G4HadronInelasticProcess.cc to allow for ion interactions.

hadronic/cross_sections:
New functionality added: Cross-section classes for ion-ion reactions,
and for
ion reactions on Hydrogen.

hadronic/processes:
New process for ion induced reactions was added.

hadronic/models/isotope_production:
New functionality added: A model for proton induced isotope production
was
added; validity range is the proton spallation energy range; To use
this, an
update of the G4NDL library is still required.

hadronic/models/low_energy:
changes in nucleon and ion induced reaction classes to adapt to the
memory 
management policy of G4FastVector;

hadronic/models/high_energy:
No changes; known bug - energy non conservation.

hadronic/models/neutron_hp:
A set of fixes to allow for slightly inconsistent numbers in the
data-files.
Enables production of residual nuclei for some inelastic final states.

hadronic/models/generator/de_excitation:
Design iteration to allow re-use of root-finding algorithms;
tuning/debugging

hadronic/models/generator/diffractive_string:
no changes

hadronic/models/generator/high_energy:
no changes

hadronic/models/generator/kinetic_model:
no changes

hadronic/models/generator/management:
no changes

hadronic/models/generator/pre_equilibrium:
no changes

hadronic/models/generator/quark_gluon_string:
New feature: Added gamma annihilation cross-sections and
anti-nucleaon-nucleon
annihilation; Bug fixes in AntiSigma SU(12) wafe-function. Extended
G4SPBaryon.

hadronic/models/generator/string_common:
no changes

hadronic/models/generator/string_fragmentation:
G4VLongitudinalStringDecay extended to allow string excitation dependent
parameters.

hadronic/models/generator/util:
Bug-fixes and added functionality in G4KineticTrack;
Removing compiler warnings in G4Fancy3DNucleus,
G4NuclearShellModelDensity, etc..
