- Fixes for porting on supported platforms/compilers:
  o STEPfile.h: removed declaration of function HeaderId(int)
    since not used and NOT implemented;
  o sdai[.h.cc]: replaced use of MAXLONG and MINFLOAT with LONG_MAX
    and FLT_MIN respectively.
  o STEPfile_inline.cc: added explicit cast to float in argument for
    'ceil' function.
