                       geant4-01-01-ref-04
                       ===================

The recommended reference tag "geant4-01-01-ref-04" for Geant4 members
is now available.
Libraries, examples and tests have been built successfully on the
supported platforms as part of the testing cycle.
In addition, validation tests have been built and run successfully
on DEC-cxx (v. 6.1, native STL) and HP-aCC (v. A.01.23, native STL).

Please see below for details of the most relevant fixes
included in this 'development-release'.

The next tag for the public release 2.0 is scheduled for June 30th.

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last
recommended reference tag are:
    - updated most headers in the geometry module for comments to be
      included in the Software Reference Manual.
      Fixes to magnetic-field and solids/CSG modules.
    - Fixed configuration problem in persistency module.
A more complete list is available below.


How to update a development tree
--------------------------------

Access to the Geant4 CVS repository is required in order to update
a source code directory of Geant4. If you maintain such a development
tree to update it you should do the following:

 cd $G4INSTALL
 cvs update -r geant4-01-01-ref-04 -d -P

For developers only:
 |    You will need an extract step in order to update the tree of
 |  the category that you develop.  Assuming that your developments
 |  are in the head of CVS, you should do the following:
 |
 |      cd 
 |      cvs update -d -P -A
 |
 |  Then you'll need to resolve any clashes you may get.


---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:

config
------
- Implemented modular setup. Now system specific configurations are 
  grouped in separated files $G4SYSTEM.gmk and placed in the new 
  directory config/sys. 

electromagnetic processes
-------------------------
- Low-energies processes:
  o fixes in G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung for continuous energy loss.

geometry
--------
- Magnetic Field: 
  o fixes to G4MagErrorStepper (check on chord endpoint), 
    G4RKG3_Stepper (deleted error message from StepNoErr), 
    G4MagIntegratorDriver (modified debug information). 
  o minor fix to dummy implementation of assignment operator 
    in G4MagneticField.hh. 
  o modified method for finding new trial step in G4ChordFinder. 
- Volumes:
  o introduced kCarTolerance for check over taken step length and 
    TruePathLength in G4PropagatorInField::ComputeStep(). 
- CSG Solids:
  o fixes in DistanceToIn(p,v) for G4Box and G4Trd to return zero
    distance in case computed value is less than 0.5*kCarTolerance.
  o fix to G4Tubs::DistanceToOut(p,v,...) in computation of xi, yi
    for (sphi>=-0.5*kCarTolerance). Fixes problem reports #76 and #91. 
  o added more diagnostics in case of invalid enum for DistanceToOut.
- Boolean Solids:
  o temporarily disabled CreatePolyhedron() by forcing return of NULL
    pointer. Therefore, visualization of Boolean solids is temporarily
    disabled, pending definitive fix in graphics_reps BooleanProcessor.
- Changed comments to headers for the Software Reference Manual in
  management, volumes, magnetic-field, CSG/Boolean modules.
  Removed obsolete file G4Transform.hh.

graphics representations
------------------------
- Minor fix to HepPolyhedron code for ISO/ANSI compliance.

visualization
-------------
- Added command /vis/viewer/reset. 
- G4VViewer: added method GetShortName(), corrected SetName(...). 
- G4ViewParameters.hh: improved class description. 
- G4VisManager: added ViewerShortName(...) and GetViewer(...) utilities. 
- G4RayTracer: set out-of-world ray to black. 
- G4RayTracerViewer: corrected trapping of orthogonal projection.
