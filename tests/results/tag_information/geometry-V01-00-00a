 I made available a general tag of geometry "geometry-V01-00-00a",
 which includes some minor fixes to the unit tests that were not
 included in 'geometry-V01-00-00". They essentially refer to some
 missing G4cout migrations and other minor compilation problems due
 to the tests not being up-to-date with the recent development.
 This tag does not invalidate any system test, since no change is
 apported to the kernel libraries.
