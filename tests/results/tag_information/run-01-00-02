PLEASE NOTE that these modifications affect on ALL examples and test 
programs. I'm affraid to say but I will start committing the corrections 
on geant4/examples and geant4/test directories on the coming week.
Please correct your local test codes by yourself... Please consult to
the newly committed header files of the user action classes. I'm soory
for my lazyness but, you know, these modifications affect on so many
places as we had already realized at the last TSB meeting.

                                        Cheers,
                                                Makoto Asai
