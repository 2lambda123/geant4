Dear STT members,

  I've committed and tagged "run" category on behalf of Makoto.
  
  Major modification is
 
  1) Removed G4VPhysicsList::ConstructAllParticles and related methods.

  2) Modified SetCuts method (SetCuts take no argument now)

   Modification 1) is introduced to resolve dependencies on all particle
granular libraries in G4VUserPhysicsList pointed out by John and Simone as
listed below.

   As noted by Makoto, these modifications also affect on ALL examples and test
programs. I and Makoto will start committing the corrections on geant4/examples
and geant4/test directories.
    
Best Regards,
                                                        Hisaya
