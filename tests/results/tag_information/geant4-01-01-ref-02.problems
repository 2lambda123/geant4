                 Problems with geant4-01-01-ref-02
                 =================================

Same as the problems with geant4-01-01-ref-01.

Here is a more detailed report from Steve O'Neale:

 A full range of platforms have had the "standard" and "Large_N" tests
 run for geant4-01-01-ref-01-tags22 in dev1.

 Looking through the test02.hadron, test11 and test15 large_N.out
 files I noted a number of problems which I believe have already been
 reported.

 1)

 Error in G4ParticleWithCuts::ConvertCutToKineticEnergy is seen
 throughout the tests, for example in ionIoni: and eBrem: as below,
 and execution continues.

 ionIoni: 
 ******** SetCuts for gamma ******************** 
 The maximal meaningful cut is 857.187 mm. 
 All the gammawill be killed ! in the material Aluminium.
 Error in G4ParticleWithCuts::ConvertCutToKineticEnergy
 ******** ConvertCutToKineticEnergy for gamma ********************
 The cut energy is set 1.79769e+305GeV

 (This becuase we set the cuts to a large distance to reduce the time
 spent in electromagnetic processes in hadron tests.)
     
 2)

  G4NeutronHPNames: Sorry, this material does not come near to any data. 
  G4NeutronHPNames: Please make sure NeutronHPCrossSections points to the
                  directory, the neutron scattering data are located in.

  is reported for 
  DEC-cxx/debug_ISO     test11.out    
  DEC-cxx/optim_ISO     test11.out        
  DEC-cxx/debug_ISO     test15.out     
  DEC-cxx/optim_ISO     test15.out   

  for test11 G4NeutronHPNames: The material was: A=18, Z=8 and
  for test15 G4NeutronHPNames: The material was: A=204, Z=82.

  execution stops.

3)

  A very large, negative energy deposit (and the termination of the
  test) is seen in
