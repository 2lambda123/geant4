 config-00-04-03 includes the new G4SYSTEM setup.

 - Updated architecture.gmk and binmake.gmk: G4SYSTEM revision.
 - Added +DAportable compiler option to HP-aCC setup to support
   HPPA 2.0 for PA8000 CPUs.

 Here is the list of the new G4SYSTEM flavors, please update your
 environment variables accordingly:

 new            old
 --------------------------------------------------------
 AIX-xlC        AIX-AFS
 SUN-CC         SUN-AFS
 HP-aCC         HP-aCC (removed CC support, HP-AFS)
 SGI-CC         SGI-AFS
 DEC-cxx        DEC6-AFS (removed cxx-5 support, DEC-AFS)
 Linux-g++      G++-Linux

 The following flavors have been removed from architecture.gmk:
 HP9-AFS, HP-Local, HP-G++, HP-UX, SGI-Local, SGI-G++, DEC6-AFS,
 DEC-G++, DEC-Local, OSF1, G++-Local, G++-FreeBSD.
 And also, of course:  AIX-AFS, SUN-AFS, HP-AFS, DEC-AFS, SGI-AFS.

 I also added new links to the existing installations of RW-Tools.h++
 and CLHEP at CERN. The old setup is still temporarly working by using
 an old tag of config.
 
 This tag requires a full recompilation _from scratch_ !
