     Hello vis and testers

  I have been able to reconstruct Geant4 and test201 
 on the LAL machines :
         Linux-g++
         DEC-cxx
         HP-aCC
         SunOS-CC
         NT-4.0-VC-6.0 (without Cygnus)
  It is based on 
     ref-06
     RW
     CLHEP-1.4
     granular libs

  Through test201 I focus mainly on testing interfaces
 and visualization.

  test201 have been reconstructed and tested with
     G4UIXm (on UNIX)
   + G4UIWin32 (on NT)
   + HEPVis (recent 5.1 should be ok)
   + SoFree (with a not yet release version) (UNIX and NT)
   + TGS Inventor2.5 on DEC
   + TGS Inventor2.5 on NT

  The test :
   - initialize a simple geometry
   - draw it with the new vis command system.
   - loop over events by drawing the trajectories
     (mainly an em shower).
 
  It permits me to find various problems in interfaces
 and visualization categories. Things for interfaces are committed
 and I am going to commit vis things now. In vis, mainly
 corrections are for the Inventor driver. Some touches
 vis/management : add a "ClearTransientStore' in G4VScenehandler,
 some protection over null pointers, have trajectory drawn
 as polyline by default (if not, it overflows Inventor scene graph),
 etc...
  I have already noticed other problems, like increase of the
 memory used when looping over events (trajectory badly deleted ?),
 etc...

  The size of the binaries are interesting :
    21 457 664 Linux-g++/test201
    17 412 328 HP-aCC/test201
    11 024 496 SunOS-CC/test201
    48 832 512 DEC-cxx/test201
  The 50 Mbytes of DEC are interesting...

  I plan now to have test201 running here for other ui, vis drivers
 and environments (and try perhaps to have a 100Mbytes binary on DEC !).

    Cheers   

      Guy

PS : All this is exhausting ; it tooks me quite two weeks 
     to have test201 on all these platforms ; too long...
PSPS : As I have said, because I want to concentrate on the 
       visualization, I don't plan to jump in the STL things.
