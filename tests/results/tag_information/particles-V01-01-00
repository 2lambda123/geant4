  A new tag of "particles-V01-01-00" for particles category has been committed.

  In the new tag, new property of "particle sub-type" in G4ParticleDefinition is
added for all particles. 
                
    - Set particle sub-type for particles
        bosons-V01-00-00
        leptons-V01-00-00
        hadrons-V01-00-01
        shortlived-V01-00-02

    - Added sub-type information in G4ParticleDefinition::DumpTable
        partman-V01-00-03


  This "particle sub-type" can be used to know particle name without charge
information. 
  For example 
        G4PionPlus, G4PionZero, and G4PionMinus have the same sub-type of "pi"
        G4Proton, and G4Neutron (and their anti-particles) have the same sub-type of
"nucleon"
        G4TauPlus, and G4NeutrinoTau (and their anti-particles) have the same sub-type
of "tau"
        All charged states (and their anti-particles) of delta(1600) have the same
sub-type of "delta(1700)"
