- Made G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid virtual.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with composite
  solids - now programmed into CompositeSolid::CreatePolyhedron, where
  CompositeSolid means G4IntersectionSolid, G4SubtractionSolid and
  G4UnionSolid.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with displaced
  solids - now programmed into G4DisplacedSolid::CreatePolyhedron.
- Added G4LogicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid, which explicitly adds
  components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.
- Removed unnecessary #includes from G4VSceneHandler.hh which required
  consequent inclusion in many other scene handlers and viewers.

These tags include changes for the first implementation of boolean
solid visualization with G4Polyhedron objects.  All graphics systems
should now be able to visualize boolean solids.  Note there are still
problems for boolean solids whose components have shared surfaces.

Vizzers, please try these tags.  Note there has also been some moving
of #include statements from G4VSceneHandler.hh to several .cc files.
I hope I've caught all cases - I believe I have all VIS environment
variables set - but please try your favourite system.
