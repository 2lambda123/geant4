The G3toG4 code has been updated with the modifications from Pedro and
Ivana. Bill has performed the STL map migration and Gabriele has merged
the code back onto the main CVS trunk and has tagged it as
g3tog4-V00-01-cand03.

Bill has persomed some preliminary tests. cltog4/clGeometry can be run
with svtwaf.dat and parity.dat. However, these data files do not test the
divided volumes/deferred positioning code. The file testmodel.dat
currently does not work. It is derived from a G3 geometry which tests
divisions: two tubes are divided radially and in in phi
deferred positioning and negative volume parameters: a box with negative
length parameters is placed inside a box whose parameters are deferred
till positioning time.

Neither of these two tests seems to be working properly at present.

The divsion code 'works' on the first run/beamOn command, but then goes
into an infinite loop on subsequent beamOn commands.
