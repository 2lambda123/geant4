----------------
- STLInterface: implemented correct behavior for vectors' default
  constructors, as expected by the RW interface.
  o for pointer/value ordered/sorted collections, an EMPTY STL vector
    is created and the vector capacity is set to G4RWDEFAULT_CAPACITY
    using vector::reserve(capacity). No element initialisation is done.
  o for pointer/value simple collections, a default constructor
    creating an EMPTY STL vector is implemented; the constructor
    taking the capacity as argument, creates an STL vector of the
    given capacity and explicitly initialises its elements.
    NB: pointers are initialised to zero.
- Added "g4std/complex" wrapper file (V.Grichine)
