Those two tags are made in order to decouple the visu from the
parameterisation.

The intercoms-01-00-01 tag contains the new files:

        o include/G4VGlobalFastSimulationManager.hh
        o include/G4VFlavoredParallelWorld.hh
        o src/G4VGlobalFastSimulationManager.cc

which defines pure abstract classes used as interfaces by the visu.

The param-01-00-02 tag implements the:

        o G4GlobalFastSimulationManager
        o G4FlavoredParallelWorld

concrete classes, inheriting from the intercoms related classes.

vis-01-00-08 requires those two tags to work.

In order to test param-01-00-02 and intercoms-01-00-01 locally I
changed and tested the following visualisation files for vis-01-00-08:

management/src/G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc
management/src/G4VisManMessDraw.cc
modeling/include/G4FlavoredParallelWorldModel.hh
modeling/src/G4FlavoredParallelWorldModel.cc

 Both  visualisation/management and visualisation/modeling compile even
without the -I../process/parameterisation/include option in the
GNUMakefile. So it believe I achieved to decouple it.
