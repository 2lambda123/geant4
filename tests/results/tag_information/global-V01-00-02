- STLInterface: several fixes.
  o Fixed bug in G4String::toUpper().
    (bug was introduced inadvertently on 20-Oct-1999).
  o Added checks for bound-overflows in G4RWTPtrSortedVector::find().
  o Fixed bound-check for operators () and [] in most collections:
    () access operators DO NOT perform bound-checking (except if
       G4DEBUG set);
    [] access operators DO perform bound-checking.
  o tpvector[.h.icc]: changed 'unsigned int' to 'size_t' in
    constructors. Added 'rwsize' and bound-checking for operator[].
  o tvvector.icc: added call to std_vector() in default constructor.
  o tpordvec.icc: added std_pvector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.
  o tvordvec.icc: added std_vector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.
