                 Problems with geant4-01-01-ref-05
                 =================================

This tag co-works with CLHEP-1.5 which has fixed the
G4VParticleChange::CheckIt problem.  Other problems are as
geant4-01-01-ref-04.

Problems with geant4-01-01-ref-05 are:
--------------------------------------

All ISO modes: T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.


Large N problems:
-----------------

Conducted only on Sun and Linux.  Note that the problem with T02 in
"SUN: debug: NON-ISO" prevented other tests, possibly masking other
problems.

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: T02 loops - grows to 90+MB after an hour or so, then
                     stable for at least 100 hours.
     optim: NON-ISO: T09: theListOfSecondaries is not empty.
            NON-ISO: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit
                          is negative!!

Linux: debug: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
       optim: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
