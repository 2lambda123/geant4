1st December 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-15)
- architecture.gmk:
  o added new G4SYSTEM flavor SUN-CC5, used for testing on the new C++
    compiler v5.0 on SunOS. Requires ISO/ANSI-C++ installation and
    native STL by default. Compatibility with old no ISO/ANSI code is
    assured through the -compat compiler option and the usage of
    ObjectSpace STL (i.e. G4USE_OSPACE set).
  o added new flag G4NO_STD_NAMESPACE.
    HP-aCC setup with native STL assumes the ISO-ANSI installation by
    default, the new flag should be explicitly set in the environment
    to avoid this.
  o upgraded SGI-CC setup to IRIX 6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 and ObjectSpace STL.
    Tests on this configuration has NOT been tested though.
