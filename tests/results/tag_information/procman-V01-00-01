  I've committed a new tag of "procman-V01-00-01" for process/management
category. 
   
  New features in the tag are:

-  Use STL vector instead of RW vectors (except for G4ProcessVector) 
-  Add registration of process into ProcessTable in copy constructor  

  The second point is modification to fix a problem that Process Table does not
recognize processes attached to ions which are created on the fly.

  The first point is modification for migration from RW to STL. G4ProcessVector,
however, still uses RW vector (i.e. use RW-STL interface) because it widely used
in Geant4 (in tracking and many processes) and changes will cause big effects in
many places. I'm now working to estimate the effects and after that I'll propose
design change of G4ProcessVector.
  
 Best Regards,
                                                Hisaya
