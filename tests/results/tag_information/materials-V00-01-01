I have made the following commits to the HEAD of
source/material/include:

G4MPVEntry.hh
G4MaterialPropertyVector.hh
G4OpticalSurface.hh

These files now include comments (a la Katsuya) and no longer refer to
RD44 - comment changes only.

G4MaterialPropertiesTable.hh

The above, and the migration from RWTPtrHashDictionary to STL map;
thanks to John and Gabriele.

I have also made the following commits to the HEAD of
source/material/src:

G4MPVEntry.cc
G4MaterialPropertyVector.cc
G4OpticalSurface.cc

no longer refer to RD44 - comment changes only.

G4MaterialPropertiesTable.cc

The above, and the migration from RWTPtrHashDictionary to STL map;
thanks to John and Gabriele.

The /source/material HEAD should be tagged for the next global tag for
the STT.

Thanks, Peter.
