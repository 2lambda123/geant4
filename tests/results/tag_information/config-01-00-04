 Dear colleagues,

 by using "config-01-00-04" you'll compile your code against the new
 CLHEP version 1.4 now installed at CERN. It requires a complete
 re-compilation of the G4 code.
 In this version CLHEP_BASE_DIR has been temporarly moved to
     /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/dev/CLHEP/$G4SYSTEM/new
 it will be moved back to "pro" (where the "pro" link will be
 updated) as soon as your tests will be completed.
 Note that for DEC-cxx I installed a customized version of the CLHEP
 library where I explicitly disabled the ISO-ANSI features which are
 activated by default (for DEC and Win/NT) in the CLHEP installation
 setup.
 Tested on DEC.
                     Cheers, Gabriele
