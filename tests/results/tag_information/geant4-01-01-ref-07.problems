                 Problems and Fixes in geant4-01-01-ref-07
                 =========================================

Fixes
-----

The following problems reported with geant4-01-01-cand-07 are fixed
(refer to attached report):

  T02.hadron:  Looped or crashed on all platforms.

  DEC: optim: ISO: T16: G4CameronTruranHilfShellCorrections: out of table
                        for Z = 1, but finished normally.
  (This was declared correct behaviour but the message still goes to error
  output.  This is a note to remind the testing team to filter it out.)

  T14: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt on HP.

  All platforms: Em2: parameter value is not listed in the candidate List.

Problems remaining
------------------

a) with proposed fixes being tested:

   T17: Command terminated by signal 11 on Linux.

b) with a proposal to postpone:

   All ISO modes: T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.

c) being investigated:

   DEC: debug: NON-ISO: T18: Curious crash in string comparison with positron.

d) Still waiting for report on NT.

                 Problems with geant4-01-01-cand-07
                 ==================================

This is all the tags (bar some bug fixes) for the release.

The following problems reported with geant4-01-01-ref-06 are fixed
(refer to attached report):

N02: terminated abnormally on DEC and SUN.

New problems:

T02.hadron:  Looped or crashed on all platforms.

DEC: optim: ISO: T16: G4CameronTruranHilfShellCorrections: out of table
                      for Z = 1, but finished normally.

DEC: debug: NON-ISO: T18: Cannot find z12.a24 and terminates.

                 Problems with geant4-01-01-ref-06
                 =================================

This tag contains all electromagnetic tags for the release, but no
hadron tags.  New problems seem to be:

N02: terminated abnormally on DEC and SUN.
T14: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt on HP.
T17: Command terminated by signal 11 on Linux (this could be related
     to the problem seen on Linux with the first em tags, fixed by new
     tags of em standard and muons).

Quibbles:
---------

The following messages appear on error output (G4cerr) but do not
cause a G4Exception.  Either, output should go to G4cout or
G4Exception should be called?  From a testing point of view we would
like to know that error output indicates a significant error.

In general, messages from intercoms is written to G4cerr.  E.g.,
"parameter value is not listed in the candidate List".

DEC: debug:     ISO: T02.hadron: (Large N report - see below.)

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: P02: Warnings on error output - see
                     $STTBASE/SUN-CC/debug-NONISO/$STTTAG/SUN-CC/test402.err
                     (could these be moved to G4cout?).


Large N problems (where these differ from the above problems):
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following problems from previous large N tests seem to be fixed:

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: T02 loops - grows to 90+MB after an hour or so, then
                     stable for at least 100 hours.
     optim: NON-ISO: T09: theListOfSecondaries is not empty.
            NON-ISO: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit
                          is negative!!

Linux: debug: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
       optim: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!


A different problem now manifests itself.  Tests run on DEC, Linux and
SUN (not run on HP due to system problem).

DEC: debug:     ISO: T02.hadron: *** Error in G4HEInelastic::GenerateNBodyEvent
                                 total mass (1.87654) >= total energy (1.8557)
                                 but it runs to completion (user 3350.7).
                                 (Should it cause a G4Exception?)
DEC: debug: NON-ISO: T02.hadron: As ISO (user 2405.4).
