- Made /vis/ commands from /vis~/.  The idea is to maintain backwards
  compatibility while allowing us to "deprecate" the old commands over
  a period of time.  Some of these /vis/ commands respond with "superceded",
  i.e., superceded by new commands, but still available in /vis~/.

- 08/12/98 : G.Barrand : OpenInventor : due to 
  huge load problems on various platforms, init only
  the HEPVis things that are needed.
