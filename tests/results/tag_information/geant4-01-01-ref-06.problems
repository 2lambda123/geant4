                 Problems with geant4-01-01-ref-06
                 =================================

This tag contains all electromagnetic tags for the release, but no
hadron tags.  New problems seem to be:

N02: terminated abnormally on DEC and SUN.
T14: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt on HP.
T17: Command terminated by signal 11 on Linux (this could be related
     to the problem seen on Linux with the first em tags, fixed by new
     tags of em standard and muons).

Summary
-------

NOTE: STTBASE=/afs/cern.ch/user/s/stesting/stt/dev2
      STTTAG=stt.geant4-01-01-ref-05+tags111

All platforms: Em2: parameter value is not listed in the candidate List.

All ISO modes: T11, T15: problem reading neutron data.

DEC: debug:     ISO: N02: terminated abnormally.
DEC: debug: NON-ISO: N02: terminated abnormally.
DEC: optim:     ISO: N02: terminated abnormally.
                     T02.hadron: terminated abnormally.
DEC: optim: NON-ISO: (Not run due to system change.)

HP: debug: T14: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
                (see $STTBASE/HP-aCC/debug/$STTTAG/HP-aCC/test14.out for
                more details.)
HP: optim: T14: (As debug.)

Linux: debug: T17: Command terminated by signal 11.
Linux: optim: T17: (As debug.)

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: N02: terminated abnormally.
SUN: optim: NON-ISO: N02: (As debug.)


Quibbles:
---------

The following messages appear on error output (G4cerr) but do not
cause a G4Exception.  Either, output should go to G4cout or
G4Exception should be called?  From a testing point of view we would
like to know that error output indicates a significant error.

In general, messages from intercoms is written to G4cerr.  E.g.,
"parameter value is not listed in the candidate List".

DEC: debug:     ISO: T02.hadron: (Large N report - see below.)

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: P02: Warnings on error output - see
                     $STTBASE/SUN-CC/debug-NONISO/$STTTAG/SUN-CC/test402.err
                     (could these be moved to G4cout?).


Large N problems (where these differ from the above problems):
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following problems from previous large N tests seem to be fixed:

SUN: debug: NON-ISO: T02 loops - grows to 90+MB after an hour or so, then
                     stable for at least 100 hours.
     optim: NON-ISO: T09: theListOfSecondaries is not empty.
            NON-ISO: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit
                          is negative!!

Linux: debug: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!
       optim: T11: G4VParticleChange::CheckIt: the energy deposit is negative!!


A different problem now manifests itself.  Tests run on DEC, Linux and
SUN (not run on HP due to system problem).

DEC: debug:     ISO: T02.hadron: *** Error in G4HEInelastic::GenerateNBodyEvent
                                 total mass (1.87654) >= total energy (1.8557)
                                 but it runs to completion (user 3350.7).
                                 (Should it cause a G4Exception?)
DEC: debug: NON-ISO: T02.hadron: As ISO (user 2405.4).
