- design iteration on multi-fragmentation
- isotope-production models for neutron induced production, 
  and corresponding design changes in hadronic/management
- additional string model for proton induced reactions.
==>
- u.u. memory usage optimization in the neutron transport.

this will come together with an updated set of neutron data 
files.

Many greetings, 
              Hans-Peter.
