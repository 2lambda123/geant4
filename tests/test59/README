                            -------

Histogramming of multiple scattering in thick targets. It can be used
for testing of G4QElastic with additional EM part.
	
                       Geometry.
                       =========
 
The target is a InWorldBox with
1. the particula material and
2. the thickness of an absorber.
 
                       Physics.
                       ========
 Different physics processes can be activated (e.g. G4QElastic)
         	
                      Particle gun.
                      =============
 
 A single particle with the defined energy and angular distribution hits the target.
 
                     Tracking.
                     =========
 
 Collection of the secondaries is in StackingAction class and its Messenger.
 Step limitation can be made by the StepMax class and its Messenger.
 
                     Visualization
                     =============
 
 is initialized by vis.mac or interactively.
  	
                     Data collection.
                     ================
  	
 At the end of a run an angle distribution of particles is collected.
 
                     Start up sequence.
                     ==================
 > cd tests/test59
 > gmake
 > test59 gui.mac

                     The output histogram of the angular distribution
                     ================================================
	
Output is in a form of the printed vectors, which can be cut & pasted for analysis
