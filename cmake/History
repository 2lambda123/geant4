History file for Geant4 CMake build scripts.
It DOES NOT substitute the SVN log-message one should put at every
committal in the SVN repository !

Entries MUST use the following format:


MONTH DAY YEAR - INITIAL.SURNAME (TAG)
- FILECHANGED : Document changes made.

- OTHERFILECHANGED : Document changes made.


You should keep two lines between each date.
TAG is optional. If your changes fix a bug listed in the Geant4 Bugzilla,
add this in the documentation for the changed file as [BUGFIX #BUGNUMBER].

July 28th 2011 - B. Morgan (cmake-V09-04-14)
- History : Added note on preferred format of entries.

- Modules/Geant4InstallData.cmake : Added guard on option and install of data so
  that this is only available on CMake >= 2.8 due to use of ExternalProject.
  (NB: Usage still broken, probably due to tar formats (CMake 2.8.1).

- Modules/UseGeant4.cmake : Forced all CXX flags to use those used to build
  Geant4 [BUGFIX #1227]. Neatified and commented internal functions for
  library/exe/test builds. Added WARNING message if GEANT4_ADD_TEST is used
  outside of the Geant4 project. Corrected(?) include of
  CMakeMacroParseArguments (MIGHT BREAK GEANT4_XXX FUNCTIONS IN UseGeant4).

- Modules/Geant4CPackBase.cmake : Added TBZ2 and ZIP types back into list of
  source package generators. Neatified the generation of the README file.
  Neatified and commented new component build commands.

- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Corrected setting of
  INSTALL_NAME_DIR for library targets [BUGFIX #1231].

- Templates/geant4-config.in : Added G4analysis library to default list of
  libraries.

- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : Added G4analysis library to Geant4_LIBRARIES
  variable. Always added for now rather than as an optional component.


July 27th 2011 - P. Mato 
- Added the downloading and installation of Geant4 Data files if the option
  GEANT4_INSTALL_DATA is set. Modified Modules/Geant4InstallData.cmake
- Initial version of CPack configuration for binaries.
  Modified Modules/Geant4CPackBase.cmake and added Templates/CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in,
    Templates/g4_small.gif 
- Initial set of files needed for testing with CTest.
  Added Modules/FindROOT.cmake, Modules/Geant, Geant4TestDriver.cmake
  Added options GEANT4_ENABLE_TESTING, GEANT4_BUILD_EXAMPLES in 
    Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake
  Inherit CMAKE_MODULE_PATH in tests. Modified Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake,
    Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in
  Added convenient macros to Templates/UseGeant4.cmake


July 5th 2011 - G.Folger  (cmake-V09-04-13)
- Modules/{Geant4LibraryBuildOptions,Geant4BuildProjectConfig}.cmake:
   protect setting of G4LIB_BUILD_DLL to happen on WIN32 only.
    (Affected examples/.../olap, which was built without this flag, 
     and failed to link)
     
July 5th 2011 - B. Morgan (cmake-V09-04-12)
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added support for
  setting GDML/Xerces variables as needed.
- Templates/geant4-environment-skeleton.in : Added unsetting/setting of
  G4LIB_USE_GDML and XERCESCROOT. These are needed to help the automated builds
  of examples in the old toolchain. XERCESCROOT uses the value of
  XERCESC_INCLUDE_DIR with one directory level stripped off the end. This
  is not 100% foolproof if an odd XercesC install is used, but should cover
  the vast majority of cases.

June 29th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-11) (In geant4-09-04-ref-06)
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Added warning about ensuring consistent compiler flag
  sets between build of Geant4 and build of user application.
- Templates/UseGeant4.cmake : Added setting of all CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_XXXX
  variables with appending of Geant4 recommended flags, and filter out
  any duplicate flags. Adding warning in documentation about this.

June 23rd 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-10)
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Added note on possible issues when building Windows
  applications using Windows 7 + VS2010 Express.
- Templates/UseGeant4.cmake : Fixed idiotic typo error in globbing expressions
  inside file(GLOB_RECURSE).

June 23rd 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-09)
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Added in missing data library package names. Added
  note in Known Issues on Mac warnings from ld due to duplicate dylibs
  (the overlinking issue as it appears on Mac).
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Added setting of INSTALL_NAME_DIR
  target property to shared libraries (only affects Mac OS X) to final
  install location of libraries. This prevents "image not found" errors when
  building an app against Geant4 (you don't need DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH set).
  CMake *should* build the dylibs with the headerpad_max_install_names flag
  so that bundling the Geant4 libraries into an app should work (you can
  repoint the app to use the bundled libraries).
  N.B. THIS IS LIKELY TO AFFECT USAGE OF CPACK LATER ON!
- Templates/UseGeant4.cmake : Fixed error in use of file(GLOB_RECURSE) so
  that globas are done only under the current source directory.

June 22nd 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-08)
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Finalized with description of using the three toolchains
  to build Geant4 applications. 
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake : Updated with patch from Pere
  Mato Vila to export use of internal CLHEP to script when used. Also upgraded
  to export details on Motif. Script is now generated for both the build and
  install trees. On CMake >= 2.8, the build tree script is made executable.
- Templates/geant4-config : Updated with patch from Pere Mato Vila to use
  internal CLHEP, plus upgrades to provide easier setting of third party paths,
  compile defintions and libraries. Added motif feature, and changed main
  prefix, lib and include directory variable replacement to that the script
  can be used form the build directory as well.
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Updated with new guides on building user applications
  using CMake and GNU make.
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : First full implementation with most
  features in place. Provides version and component checking. Setting of
  components features quite a bit of boilerplate code and a reasonable degree
  of in module processing. TODO : Investigate clean up and better
  modularization.
- Templates/UseGeant4.cmake : NEW FILE : Provides a simple CMake module which
  users can include to setup the build of a basic Geant4 application without
  needing to know too many details. Sets definitions, include directories and
  compiler flags. Provides a simple macro to collate sources in an old style
  Geant4 Example, with documetation on usage in the file.
- Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake : Set needed variables for export to
  Geant4Config.cmake script.
- Modules/Geant4MakeRules_cxx.cmake : Added -DXPNET and
  -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE to MSVC flags to make these exactly the same as
  used on old makefile system.
- Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake : Added definition G4LIB_BUILD_DLL
  needed to define import/export correctly. Done globally.
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Fleshed out further.
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : Fleshed out documentation with extra notes
  to help development.
- Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake : Added extra comments

June 21st 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-07)
- Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake : Added section for collecting
  variables to be exported to the configuration files. Rationalized config of
  Build and Install Trees so that these sections have the same structure.
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : Updates with documentation, debugging
  option and some improved setting of definitions. Still a skeleton though.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Removed reset of OpenGL variables on
  Win32 because this seems to prevent proper refind of the variables. Since we
  expect to be able to use Qt and OpenGL concurrently on Win32. This *should*
  be o.k.
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Added extra information on using Visual Studio.
- Modules/Geant4ToolChainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Removed setting of
  G4ORDPARAMTABLE as this is no longer needed.
- Templates/geant4-environment-skeleton.in : Removed setting of G4ORDPARAMTABLE.


June 20th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-06)
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Corrected typographic error in option
  test for enabling Qt on Non-Apple platforms.
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added Geant4 to
  end of G4INCLUDE path for install tree in line with changes to
  Geant4InstallDirs.
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Added Geant4 to end of installation
  destination for headers in line with changes to Geant4InstalDirs.
- Modules/Geant4InstallDirs.cmake : Removed Geant4 from INCLUDEDIR to better
  reflect standard practice. The Geant4 tag is now added to the destination in
  the install commands for headers.
- Modules/Geant4OptionalComponents.cmake : Automatically use GDML if user
  supplies XERCESC_ROOT_DIR argument.
- Modules/Geant4InstallData.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactored installation of
  examples from top level CMakeLists.txt into this file. Also provided stub
  option for installation of data libraries. We don't implement this yet
  because it appears to require some CMake 2.8 specific functionality and
  I haven't yet worked out how to reproduce this in 2.6.4.
- INSTALL.g4cmake : Rewritten for updated CMake system with full documentation
  of variables. Provided sections for describing use of the three toolchains
  for building user applications, but not fully covered yet.

June 20th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-05)
- Modules/Geant4LibraryOptions.cmake : On Unix platforms, set output directory
  for libraries to end in the 'SYSTEM-COMPILER' tag expected by the old
  toolchain. This allows the build tree to be used with the old toolchain.
  #BUGFIX - 1200 (PARTIAL)
- Modules/Geant4OptionalComponents.cmake : Now ensures that the static versions
  of the internal G4clhep and G4expat libraries are used if geant4 is built
  completely static, otherwise dynamic libs will be used. This is not perfect
  but ensures builds will not fail.
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Completely rewritten
  to use new geant4-environment-skeleton.in template. Provides full setup
  of environment from build and install trees, permitting developers to
  build applications directly using the build tree. Also adds all currently
  supported visualization/ui modules. Adds setting of the G4ORDPARAMTABLE
  variable to support this new resource file.
- Templates/geant4-environment-skeleton.in : NEW FILE : Universal shell script
  skeleton for generating backward compatible environment variable setup.
  # BUGFIX - 1202

June 17th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-04)
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake
  Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Updated to use new
  GEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11 variable.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Corrected type in resetting of OpenGL
  variables.
  Changed GEANT4_USE_RAYTRACERX -> GEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11 to be in line with
  what's done for other drivers.

June 17th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-03)
- Tagging : internal because this requires testing.
  Full support also requires tags:
   interfaces-V09-04-03
   opengl-V09-04-05
    
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Rewritten to enable correct switch
  between Qt and X11 based GUIs on Mac, with consistent changes in OpenGL
  location. Added in find_package for Motif. Added full option and find_package
  for locating OpenGL on Win32.
- Modules/Geant4OptionalComponents.cmake : Imporved documentation of external
  CLHEP option. GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_CLHEP made a standard option as it will
  likely be used a lot to begin with.

June 16th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-02)
- Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake : Default to building shared libraries
  on all platforms, but warn about possible link errors on MSVC when building
  both shared and static libs. Mark both library build options as advanced.
  Add warning about building granular libs as only for developers.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Reverted to version from
  cmake-V09-04-01 because of poor logic.
- Modules/FindCLHEP.cmake : UPGRADE WITH INTERFACE BREAK : Much simplified
  search structure which no longer relies on clhep-config. The user can supply
  a CLHEP_ROOT_DIR argument to point CMake to a specific installation. On UNIX
  clhep-config will be searched for under this root dir. CLHEP library and
  include path will be found under this root dir, or in the system paths.
  Version checking is also provided which follows the standard logic of
  CMake modules.
- Modules/Geant4OptionalComponents.cmake : Option to use system CLHEP is
  now automatically set to ON if the user has supplied a CLHEP_ROOT_DIR
  argument. This simplifies the interface.

June 15th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Added in option for enabling Xm (Motif)
  support with find_package for Motif headers/libraries.
  Use of Qt and X11 OpenGL have been made mutually exclusive on Mac OS X to
  prevent clashes between Framework OpenGL and X11 OpenGL. 
  Added new stub option to build OpenInventor driver
  TODO: Add FindInventor module, check build of OpenInventor category.
  Added new stub option to build Win32 OpenGL driver.
  TODO: Add Win32 build to OpenGL category.
- Templates/geant4-env.sh.in
  Templates/geant4-env.csh.in : Removed unsetting of data library environment
  variables.
  TODO : Add setting of these as an optional codeblock if data was installed
  as part of the Geant4 build.

June 15th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-01)
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Set QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS on WIN32
  to stop errors when setting LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES to a value containing
  the 'optimized' etc library link keywords. By default, FindQt4 will use
  these keywords...
  KNOWNISSUE: Using imported targets means that the Geant4Config.cmake file
  must regenerate these targets otherwise the link will fail. 

June 14th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Added build of DLL targets on
  WIN32 platforms. Export definition files are generated by genwindef from
  an archive library. If Geant4 is not built with archive libraries, a
  dummy, non-installed archive will be built an used.
  The structure largely follows that of GaudiPolicy.cmake from Pere Mato Vila.
- Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake : Added build of genwindef app
  on WIN32 platforms as an internal app, as per guidelines from
  GaudiPolicy.cmake from Pere Mato Vila.
- Modules/genwindef/genwindef.cpp
  Modules/genwindef/LibSymbolInfo.hpp
  Modules/genwindef/LibSymbolInfo.cpp:
  NEW FILES to support generation of DLL .def files on WIN32 platform.
  Courtesy of Pere Mato Vila.
- Modules/Geant4Wrapping.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactoring of options for
  Python wrapping to help in modularization. Python wrapping is not yet
  implemented in the CMake build, but this is where we'll set it up.
- Modules/Geant4OptionalComponents.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactoring of options
  for CLHEP, Expat, ZLIB, GDML, G3TOG4 from top level CMakeLists.txt to
  help with modularization.
- Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactoring of library
  build options from top level CMakeLists.txt, including global define flags, 
  global vs granular library format and static vs shared builds.
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Ensure that when static targets
  are built, they are linked to Geant4 static targets.
  TODO: Do we want to make this the case also for external libraries (very
  difficult?)?
  KNOWNISSUE: G4global will always be linked to shared G4clhep if latter is
  built as will G4processes to shared G4expat. Not critical (well, shouldn't 
  affect running or applications).

June 13th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4CPackBase.cmake : Added to list of files to be excluded for
  source package so that .svn and top level tests directories are not added.
  Fixed source package generator so that .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and .zip packages
  are created.
  Tidied up structure so that future changes are easier to add in a clear
  way.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Removed accidently commited change
 of finding VTK as a test of find_package.

June 10th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Templates/geant4-config.in : Adapted to use new install directories as
  provided by Geant4InstallDirs as template parameters.
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake : Added support for new
  install directories defined in Geant4InstallDirs
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added support for
  new install directories defined in Geant4InstallDirs.
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Added support for install of
  libraries and headers to new install paths defined by Geant4InstallDirs.
  Added EXPORT to library targets so that they can be used by Geant4Config
  scripts. 
  Added proper COMPONENT argument to install commands to correctly partition
  targets needed for Development and for Runtime.
  Appended each library target and include paths to global
  properties so these can be exported to Geant4Config file easily for use
  from the build tree. 
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : NEW FILE : Template versioning file
  for use by Geant4Config.cmake.
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : NEW FILE : Template files for CMake
  config script for Geant4. VERY PRELIMINARY.
- Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.in : NEW FILE : Builds CMake Config scripts
  to allow external projects to use Geant4 from a build or install tree.
- Modules/Geant4InstallDirs.cmake : NEW FILE : Adds a standard set of 
  installation location based on the GNU set. Adapted from GNUInstallDirs
  provided with CMake 2.8, but cut down to only use directories needed by 
  Geant4.
- Modules/CMakeUninstallTarget.cmake : NEW FILE : Adds an 'uninstall' target
  to remove all items installed via the install command.
- History: Corrected a couple of entries with incorrect year in the date.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake: Set GEANT4_ADD_FEATURE for all
  UI/Vis options so that enabled options are reported at the end of
  configuration.


May 25th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Added new GEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11
  option to enable build of OpenGL library X11 component. If enabled, will
  search for X11 libraries (plus Xmu, which FindX11 doesn't do) and OpenGL.
  Also performed some cleanup of the Qt section.
- Templates/geant4-env.sh.in : Added variable setting for OpenGL X11
- Templates/geant4-env.csh.in : Added variable setting for OpenGL X11
- Templates/geant4-config.in : Added needed reporting and flags setting for
  OpenGL X11 support.
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added setting of 
  variable needed to export the existence of OpenGL X11 in the geant4-env
  scripts.
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake : Added setting of variables
  needed to export OpenGL X11 existence and X11 flags to geant4-config script.


May 24th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-00)
- *** All History for the CMake category will now be in this file ***
- Templates/geant4-env.sh.in : Added variable setting for RayTracerX
