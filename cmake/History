History file for Geant4 configuration scripts.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

June 15th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-01)
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Set QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS on WIN32
  to stop errors when setting LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES to a value containing
  the 'optimized' etc library link keywords. By default, FindQt4 will use
  these keywords...
  KNOWNISSUE: Using imported targets means that the Geant4Config.cmake file
  must regenerate these targets otherwise the link will fail. 

June 14th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Added build of DLL targets on
  WIN32 platforms. Export definition files are generated by genwindef from
  an archive library. If Geant4 is not built with archive libraries, a
  dummy, non-installed archive will be built an used.
  The structure largely follows that of GaudiPolicy.cmake from Pere Mato Vila.
- Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake : Added build of genwindef app
  on WIN32 platforms as an internal app, as per guidelines from
  GaudiPolicy.cmake from Pere Mato Vila.
- Modules/genwindef/genwindef.cpp
  Modules/genwindef/LibSymbolInfo.hpp
  Modules/genwindef/LibSymbolInfo.cpp:
  NEW FILES to support generation of DLL .def files on WIN32 platform.
  Courtesy of Pere Mato Vila.
- Modules/Geant4Wrapping.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactoring of options for
  Python wrapping to help in modularization. Python wrapping is not yet
  implemented in the CMake build, but this is where we'll set it up.
- Modules/Geant4OptionalComponents.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactoring of options
  for CLHEP, Expat, ZLIB, GDML, G3TOG4 from top level CMakeLists.txt to
  help with modularization.
- Modules/Geant4LibraryBuildOptions.cmake : NEW FILE : Refactoring of library
  build options from top level CMakeLists.txt, including global define flags, 
  global vs granular library format and static vs shared builds.
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Ensure that when static targets
  are built, they are linked to Geant4 static targets.
  TODO: Do we want to make this the case also for external libraries (very
  difficult?)?
  KNOWNISSUE: G4global will always be linked to shared G4clhep if latter is
  built as will G4processes to shared G4expat. Not critical (well, shouldn't 
  affect running or applications).

June 13th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4CPackBase.cmake : Added to list of files to be excluded for
  source package so that .svn and top level tests directories are not added.
  Fixed source package generator so that .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and .zip packages
  are created.
  Tidied up structure so that future changes are easier to add in a clear
  way.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Removed accidently commited change
 of finding VTK as a test of find_package.

June 10th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Templates/geant4-config.in : Adapted to use new install directories as
  provided by Geant4InstallDirs as template parameters.
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake : Added support for new
  install directories defined in Geant4InstallDirs
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added support for
  new install directories defined in Geant4InstallDirs.
- Modules/Geant4MacroLibraryTargets.cmake : Added support for install of
  libraries and headers to new install paths defined by Geant4InstallDirs.
  Added EXPORT to library targets so that they can be used by Geant4Config
  scripts. 
  Added proper COMPONENT argument to install commands to correctly partition
  targets needed for Development and for Runtime.
  Appended each library target and include paths to global
  properties so these can be exported to Geant4Config file easily for use
  from the build tree. 
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : NEW FILE : Template versioning file
  for use by Geant4Config.cmake.
- Templates/Geant4Config.cmake.in : NEW FILE : Template files for CMake
  config script for Geant4. VERY PRELIMINARY.
- Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.in : NEW FILE : Builds CMake Config scripts
  to allow external projects to use Geant4 from a build or install tree.
- Modules/Geant4InstallDirs.cmake : NEW FILE : Adds a standard set of 
  installation location based on the GNU set. Adapted from GNUInstallDirs
  provided with CMake 2.8, but cut down to only use directories needed by 
  Geant4.
- Modules/CMakeUninstallTarget.cmake : NEW FILE : Adds an 'uninstall' target
  to remove all items installed via the install command.
- History: Corrected a couple of entries with incorrect year in the date.
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake: Set GEANT4_ADD_FEATURE for all
  UI/Vis options so that enabled options are reported at the end of
  configuration.


May 25th 2011 - B.Morgan
- Modules/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake : Added new GEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11
  option to enable build of OpenGL library X11 component. If enabled, will
  search for X11 libraries (plus Xmu, which FindX11 doesn't do) and OpenGL.
  Also performed some cleanup of the Qt section.
- Templates/geant4-env.sh.in : Added variable setting for OpenGL X11
- Templates/geant4-env.csh.in : Added variable setting for OpenGL X11
- Templates/geant4-config.in : Added needed reporting and flags setting for
  OpenGL X11 support.
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added setting of 
  variable needed to export the existence of OpenGL X11 in the geant4-env
  scripts.
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake : Added setting of variables
  needed to export OpenGL X11 existence and X11 flags to geant4-config script.


May 24th 2011 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-04-00)
- *** All History for the CMake category will now be in this file ***
- Templates/geant4-env.sh.in : Added variable setting for RayTracerX
- Templates/geant4-env.csh.in : Added variable setting for RayTracerX
- Templates/geant4-config.in : Added needed reporting and flags setting for
  RayTracerX support.
- Modules/Geant4ToolchainBackwardCompatibility.cmake : Added setting of 
  variable needed to export the existence of RayTracerX in the geant4-env
  scripts.
- Modules/Geant4ConfigureConfigScript.cmake : Added setting of variables
  needed to export RayTracerX existence and X11 flags to geant4-config script.


December 3rd 2010 - B. Morgan (cmake-V09-03-01)
- Added generation of geant4-config script.

October 29th 2010 - B. Morgan
- Install.g4cmake: Added as installation guide for using CMake.

October 1st, 2010 - B.Morgan (cmake-V09-03-00)
- Created. First Alpha version of CMake build system.
