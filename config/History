6th May 1999  John Allison
- Removed extra library for circular dependencies.  Now all solved!

5th May 1999  Gabriele Cosmo
- Fixed typo in architecture.gmk and defined OSPACEDIR to point to the G4
  dev area where links to the ObjectSpace installations at CERN have been
  created for all platforms. "pro" version points to ObjectSpace 2.1.

5th May 1999  John Allison
- Eliminated all references to RW in the case of G4USE_STL.
- Added OSPACE variables.

28th April 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-01-00-04)
- architecture.gmk: moved link for CLHEP to "new" to test the new version
  1.4 of CLHEP. It will become "pro" again as soon as the new CLHEP will be
  validated. NOTE: for DEC-cxx a custom CLHEP installation is used in order
  to deactivate the ISO-ANSI options now set by default in CLHEP.

19th April 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-01-00-03)
- architecture.gmk: introduced CCFLAGS for all platforms. Set CCFLAGS to
  "-Ae +DAportable" for HP-aCC to overcome compilation problems on liblist.c

18th April 1999  Youhei Morita
- architecture.gmk, binmake.gmk: introduced OBJY_LDLIB variable for
  defining Objectivity library within G4ODBMS.

13th April 1999  Gabriele Cosmo
- architecture.gmk: added the following options in compilation:
  o HP-aCC, SGI-CC: +Onolimit, -Olimit 5000 respectively.
    Not suppress any optimization specifying a high or unlimited memory
    limitation.
  o DEC-cxx: -timplicit_local.
    Get rid of the template repository by generating explicit template
    instantiations used in the code with internal linkage.
    
13th April 1999  John Allison
- In binmake.gmk: - moved libmap target to source/GNUmakefile.
                  - extensive tidying.

12th April 1999  John Allison
- In liblist.c:  - fixed bug to distinguish, e.g., track from tracking.
                 - improved printing.
                 - improved "Usage" comments.
                 - improved protection against bad input format.
- In binmake.gmk, used $(ECHO) to solve platform dependency of echo.
- In binmake.gmk for granular libraries:
   - fully implemented -d option.
   - Gave /tmp files a unique name.
   - Removed repeated libraries - no longer necessary, all circular
       dependencies seem solved.

9th April 1999  Frank Behner
- Fixed bug in liblist in -d option
- Changed binmake.gmk to use liblist -d

18th February 1999  John Allison
