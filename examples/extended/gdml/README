     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP

                          GDML read/write
                          ---------------

This example demonstrates the usage of the GDML reader and writer. It allows
the users to export their geometry descriptions in an application independent
format (GDML, Geometry Description Markup Language).
The GDML files can be then used to interchange geometries between different
applications and users.

The detector construction consists of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses the
GDML file (test.gdml) and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user
can also write his own GDML files and use it as the primary input format for
his Geant4 application.

Once the Geant4 geometry is loaded in the memory, the G4GDMLWriter class is
instantiated (in the 'main') to demonstrate the exporting of the GDML file.
The call to DumpGeometryInfo method causes the GDML writer to scan the Geant4
geometry tree and write it out in the form of a GDML file.

HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?

- Install the GDML package with Geant4 extensions and Xerces.
  See: http://cern.ch/gdml.

- Set the environment variable GDML_BASE to point to the area where
  GDML is installed. Specify the system architecture with SCRAM_ARCH.
  Set XERCESCROOT to point to place where Xerces is installed.
  You can also edit the GNUmakefile provided with the example and
  customise it for your specific setup.

- Customise the 'test.gdml' schema file, specifying in the top line the
  right path where to retrieve the main GDML schema file (step that will
  become automatic in future).

- Compile and link to generate an executable:
 	      % gmake
 		
- Execute the application:
 	      % g4_gdml_read_write
