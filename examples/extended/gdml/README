The GDML (Geometry Description Markup Language) example demonstrates the usage
of the GDML reader and writer. It allows the users to export their geometry
descriptions in an application independent format (GDML).
The GDML files can be then used to interchange geometries between different
applications and users.

The detector construction consists of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses the
GDML file (test.gdml) and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user
can also write his own GDML files and use it as the primary input format for
his Geant4 application.

Once the Geant4 geometry is loaded in the memory, the G4GDMLWriter class is
instantiated (in the 'main') to demonstrate the exporting of the GDML file.
The call to DumpGeometryInfo method causes the GDML writer to scan the Geant4
geometry tree and write it out in the form of a GDML file.
