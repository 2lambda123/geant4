        ----------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate exotic physics applications. 
 Currently, only two examples are provided:

monopole
---------

This example is devoted to the energy deposited by classical magnetic
monopole.

phonon
------

This example simulates phonons in sub-Kelvin temperature Germanium crystal.

channeling
----------

This example simulates channeling of 400 GeV/c protons in a bent crystal.

ucn
---

This example simulates the passage of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in a
hollow pipe
