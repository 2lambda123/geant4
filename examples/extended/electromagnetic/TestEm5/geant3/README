 testem5 is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm5

 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version)
 % gmakeT           to make an executable  (inTeractive version) 

 To execute:

 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem5.xb (for batch) or  testem5.xt (for interactive)

 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:

 run01.dat      (runNN.dat is the equivalent of the G4 runNN.mac)

 data cards:  most of the data cards used in runxx.dat are
 ----------   standard data cards of GEANT3, but some of them
              are defined in testem5. These latter cards are:

              KEY      VARIABLE/type     Short description

              NAME    NAME (character)   name of the hist.file <******* 

              ABSO
	              MATABS (integer)   mat.number  of the absorber
		      XABSOR (real)      X thickness of the absorber
		      YZABSO (real)      YZ size     of the absorber

              HIS1
                      NH1    (integer)   number of bins in 1-st histogram
                      HI1(2) (real)      lower/upper limit in 1-st histogram
              .......


   ******>  the NAME data card should be the first , with the format
              A4,A2,A25.

   all the others are the so called free format data records used
   in GEANT3 .

   materials: the materials used in this test are defined in
   ---------  ugeom.F with material numbers 21 - 30
