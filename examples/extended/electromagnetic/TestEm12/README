     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            TestEm12
                            --------

     This example is devoted to the energy deposited by particles which
     across a given material.
         
     In addition, it illustrates how to use the concept of 'process' in order 
     to implement a constraint on the step size of the particle trajectories.
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
	The geometry consists of a single sphere of an homogenous material.
	Optionally, the sphere can be divided in thin shells.
     	
	3 parameters define the geometry :
 	- the material of the sphere,
	- the radius of the sphere (absorRadius),
	- the number of shells (nbOfLayers)
	 	
 	In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.
 	
 	The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
 	but all of the above parameters can be changed interactively via
 	the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST
 
 	The particle list is the one of novice/exampleN02.
 	The physics list contains the 'standard' electromagnetic processes,
 	and decay.
 		
 	Few commands have been added to PhysicsList, in order to set the
 	production threshold for secondaries either in range for gamma, e-/e+.
 	 
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 	The primary kinematic consists of a single particle randomly shooted at
	the centre of the sphere. The type of the particle and its energy are set 
 	in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can be changed via the G4 
 	build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
 	this example).
	
 	In addition one can desactivate the randomness of the direction of the 
	incident particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
 	PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.
	 	
 	A RUN is a set of events.
 	
 				
 4- VISUALIZATION
 
 	The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 	The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 	/vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
 	> /control/execute vis.mac
 	
 	The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the 
 	box.
 	
 	The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 	Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
 	or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.
 	
 	
 5- HOW TO START ?
 
 	- compile and link to generate an executable
 		% cd geant4/examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm1
 		% gmake
 		
 	- execute TestEm12 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		% TestEm12   run01.mac
 		
 	- execute TestEm12 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 		% TestEm12
 		....
 		Idle> type your commands
 		....
 		Idle> exit
		
 6- TRACKING
 
     Testem12 computes the total energy deposited along the trajectory of 
     the incident particle : the so-called longitudinal energy profile,
     or depth dose distribution
     
     In order to control the accuracy of the deposition, the user can limit
     'by hand' the maximum  step size of charged particles.
     As an example, this limitation is implemented as a 'full' process :
     see StepMax class and its Messenger. The 'StepMax process' is registered
     in the Physics List. 
     	
 7- HISTOGRAMS
 
   Testem12 has several predefined 1D histograms : 
  
      1 : energy profile dE/dr (in MeV/mm per event)
      2 : total energy deposited in the absorber
      3 : total track length of the primary track
      4 : projected range of the primary track
      5 : step size of the primary track
      6 : total track length of charged secondary tracks
      7 : step size of charged secondary tracks      
      8 : normalized energy profile d(E/E0)/d(r/r0), where r0 is the range of
          the primary particle of energy E0
            
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /testem/histo/setHisto id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /testem/histo/setFileName  name  (default testem12)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file (hbook, root, XML)
   with the command /testem/histo/setFileType (hbook by default)
       
   Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
   the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.
   
 
 8- USING HISTOGRAMS

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available (see http://aida.freehep.org).
  
 8a - PI 

  A package including AIDA and extended interfaces also using Python is PI, 
  available from: http://cern.ch/pi

  Once installed PI or PI-Lite in a specified local area $MYPY, it is required 
  to add the installation path to $PATH, i.e. for example, for release 1.2.1 of 
  PI:
  setenv PATH ${PATH}:$MYPI/1.2.1/app/releases/PI/PI_1_2_1/rh73_gcc32/bin

  CERN users can use the PATH to the LCG area on AFS.
  Before running the example the command should be issued:
  eval `aida-config --runtime csh`

 8b -  OpenScientist
 
  OpenScientist is available at http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/OpenScientist
  
  In OpenScientist, the AIDA implementation is the Lab package. 
  You have to "setup" this package before compiling (then with G4ANALYSIS_USE) 
  and running your Geant4 application.
   
  On UNIX you setup, with a csh flavoured shell : 
	csh> setenv CMTPATH <OpenScientist install path> 
	csh> source <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.csh 
  On UNIX with a sh flavoured shell : 
	sh> CMTPATH=<OpenScientist install path>;export CMTPATH 
	sh> . <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.sh 
  On Windows : 
	DOS> set CMTPATH=<OpenScientist install path> 
	DOS> call <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.bat 

  You have to use the XML or root file formats ; producing hbook files is not 
  supported by OpenScientist/Lab. But the three formats (hbook, AIDA-XML, root) 
  are readable by the interactive applications ; the Lab onx interactive 
  program or the OpenPAW program. 

  With OpenPAW, someone can view the histograms with : 
	OS> opaw 
	opaw> h/file 1 run0.aida   (or opaw> h/file 1 run1.root) 
	opaw> zone 2 2 
	opaw> h/plot 1 
	opaw> h/plot 2 
	opaw> h/plot 3
