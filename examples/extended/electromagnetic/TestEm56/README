  How to look for deexcitation products
	
 1 - GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
  It is a simple box which represente an irradiated sample.
 	
  Two parameters define the geometry :
   - the material of the sample,
   - the thickness of the sample.
	 	
  The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class, but all of 
  the above parameters can be changed interactively via the commands defined in 
  the DetectorMessenger class.
 	
 2 - PHYSICS LIST
 
  Physics lists are from G4 kernel physics_lists subdirectory.
     

   - "G4EmLivermorePhysics" For low energy processes up to 1 GeV
   - "G4EmPenelopePhysics" For very low energy EM processes
   - "G4EmStandardPhysics" For EM processes   
   - "G4EmDNAPhysics" For ultra low energy processes used for DNA interactions
             
  Physics lists and options can be (re)set with UI commands
    
  Please, notice that options set through G4EmProcessOPtions are global, eg
  for all particle types. In G4 builders (geant4/source/physics_lists/builders)
  it is shown how to set options per particle type. 
 		
  Few commands have been added to PhysicsList, in order to set the production 
  threshold for secondaries for gamma and e-/e+.
 	 
 3 - AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the left face 
  of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in the 
  PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can be changed via the G4 build-in commands 
  of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with this example).
	
  In addition one can choose randomly the impact point of the incident particle.
  The corresponding interactive command is built in PrimaryGeneratorMessenger.	
 				
 4 - VISUALIZATION
 
  The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
  The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands /vis/... in the 
  macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
	> /control/execute vis.mac
 	
  The detector has a default view which is a frontal view of the sample.
 	
  The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 	
 5 - PHYSICS SURVEY
 
  The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available in this 
  example are set in PhysicsList class.
 	
  A set of macros defining various physics lists are provided. 

  Spectra of secondaries are recorded, both for gammas and electrons.

 6 - HOW TO START ?
 
  - compile and link to generate an executable
	% cd geant4/examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm56
	% gmake
 		
  - execute TestEm56 in 'batch' mode from macro files
	% TestEm56  ionis.mac
 		
  - execute TestEm56 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
	% Testem56
	....
	Idle> type your commands
	....
	Idle> exit
		
 7 - HISTOGRAMS
 
  TestEm56 produces several histo which are saved as testem56.root by default.
  Content of these histo:  
      1 : all secondary electrons produced
      2 : all secondary gamma produced 
      3 : secondary electrons exiting the sample
      4 : secondary gammas exiting the sample 

  The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
  The histos can be individually activated with the command :
  /testem/histo/setHisto id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
  where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
  
  One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
  /testem/histo/setFileName  name  (default testem56)
  
  It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file (hbook, root, XML)
  with the command /testem/histo/setFileType (root by default)
  
  It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
  /testem/histo/printHisto id
  All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default testem56) 

  Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
  the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.
 
  Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old files:
  	gmake histclean
  	gmake 

 9 - USING HISTOGRAMS

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available. See the file InstallAida.txt
  
  NOTE: due to a problem in some AIDA implementations, hitogram file must
  be saved in uncompressed format via the command 

  /testem/histo/setFileOption uncompress
