known bugs.

- file name is always "testem11". If you try to set it with macro command it will be ignored, with a warning. This is because the master HistoManager is created before the macro file is read.

- stepping verbose not implemented for multithreaded

- stepMax not automatically calculated and set. 

- calculated values not written to G4cout for master. Need Run::Merge
