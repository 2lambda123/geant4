 testem2.cra is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm2
 
 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version) 
 % gmakeT           to make an executable  (inTeractive version)
 
 To execute:
  
 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem2.xb (for batch) or testem2.xt (for interactive)
 
 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:
 
 run01.dat      (runNN.dat is the equivalent of the G4 runNN.mac)
 
 
 testem2 produces several histo saved as testem2.histo if ISWIT(2)=1
 
 Content of these histo:
  
      1 : energy deposit       per event
      2 : charged track length per event
      3 : neutral track length per event
            
      4 : longitudinal energy profile
      5 : cumulated longitudinal energy profile
      6 : rms of cumulated longitudinal energy profile
      
      7 : gamma's flux
      8 : positron's flux
      9 : electron's flux
                      
     10 : radial energy profile    
     11 : cumulated radial energy profile
     12 : rms of cumulated radial energy profile
