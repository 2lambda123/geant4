    Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
    =========================================================

                       Extended Example A01
                       -------------------- 

  Example A01 implements a double-arm spectrometer with wire chambers, 
  hodoscopes and calorimeters.  Event simulation and collection are 
  enabled, as well as event display and analysis.  This example is
  extensively documented on the Geant4 Workshop Tutorial CD available at:
  http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/g4cd/Welcome.html


  1. GEOMETRY

     The spectrometer consists of two detector arms.  One arm provides 
     position and timing information of the incident particle while the 
     other collects position, timing and energy information of the particle
     after it has been deflected by a magnetic field centered at the 
     spectrometer pivot point.
 
       - First arm:  box filled with air, also containing:

           1 hodoscope (15 vertical strips of plastic scintillator)
           1 drift chamber (5 horizontal argon gas layers with a 
                            "virtual wire" at the center of each layer)

       - Magnetic field region: air-filled cylinder which contains
                                the field

       - Second arm:  box filled with air, also containing:

           1 hodoscope (25 vertical strips of plastic scintillator)
           1 drift chamber (5 horizontal argon gas layers with a 
                            "virtual wire" at the center of each layer)
           1 electromagnetic calorimeter: 
                 a box sub-divided along x,y and z
                 axes into cells of CsI 
           1 hadronic calorimeter: 
                 a box sub-divided along x,y, and z axes
                 into cells of lead, with a layer of 
                 plastic scintillator placed at the center 
                 of each cell


  2. PHYSICS

     This example uses the following physics processes:

       - electromagnetic:
           photo-electric effect
           Compton scattering
           pair production
           bremsstrahlung
           ionization
           multiple scattering
           annihilation

       - decay

       - transportation in a field

     and defines the following particles:
        geantino, charged geantino, gamma, all leptons, 
        pions, charged kaons

     Note that even though hadrons are defined, no hadronic processes 
     are invoked in this example.




  3. EVENT:

     An event consists of the generation of a single particle which is 
     transported through the first spectrometer arm.  Here, a scintillator 
     hodoscope records the reference time of the particle before it passes
     through a drift chamber where the particle position is measured. 
     Momentum analysis is performed as the particle passes through a magnetic
     field at the spectrometer pivot and then into the second spectrometer 
     arm.  In the second arm, the particle passes through another hodoscope
     and drift chamber before interacting in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
     Here it is likely that particles will induce electromagnetic showers.  
     The shower energy is recorded in a three-dimensional array of CsI 
     crystals.  Secondary particles from the shower, as well as primary 
     particles which do not interact in the CsI crystals, pass into the 
     hadronic calorimeter.  Here, the remaining energy is collected in a 
     three-dimensional array of scintillator-lead sandwiches.

     Several aspects of the event may be changed interactively by the user:

       - initial particle type
       - initial momentum and angle
       - momentum and angle spreads
       - type of initial particle may be randomized
       - strength of magnetic field
       - angle of the second spectrometer arm


  4. DETECTOR RESPONSE:

     All the information required to simulate and analyze an event is 
     recorded in HITS.  This information is recorded in the following 
     sensitive detectors:

       - hodoscope: 
           particle time
           particle position
           strip ID

       - drift chamber: 
           particle time
           particle position
           layer ID
 
       - electromagnetic calorimeter: 
           particle position 
           energy deposited in cell
           cell ID
  
       - hadronic calorimeter:   
           particle position 
           energy deposited in cell
           cell ID


  5. VISUALIZATION:
  
     Simulated events can be displayed on top of a representation of 
     the spectrometer.  vis.mac outputs .heprep files suitable for
     viewing in WIRED and .prims files suitable for viewing in DAWN.
     For more information on visualization with this A01 example,
     see the visualization tutorials on the Geant4 Workshop Tutorial CD
     available at:
     http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/g4cd/Welcome.html

  6. ANALYSIS:

     This example implements an AIDA-compliant analysis system which
     creates histograms, ntuples and plotters.  At the completion of a 
     simulation run a file A01.aida is produced which contains these
     data structures.  This file can be used as an input to the Java
     Analysis Studio (JAS) which allows the histograms and ntuples to 
     examined, manipulated, saved and printed.  For further details,
     see README.JAIDA.


  7. GETTING STARTED:

     Build the A01 executable:

         cd to A01
         gmake clean
         gmake

     gmake will create tmp and bin directories in your work directory. 
     The executable, named A01app, will be in /bin/$G4SYSTEM/
 
     While in directory A01, run the executable:

         ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/A01app

     which will bring up the interactive prompt:

         Idle>

     To run 10 events you can now enter:

         /run/beamOn 10

     If all goes well, a JAS window will appear containing two histograms 
     and three scatterplots.

     To terminate the job, at the prompt enter:

         exit

     Currently you must also close the JAS-AIDA window to get the job to stop.


     In the A01 directory will be a file A01.aida which contains the plots. 
     To examine them

         /usr/local.bin/jas3 & or jas3 &
