     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP

                            AnaEx01
                            -------

  This example shows the usage of histogramming with the
 analysis category. 	
 	  
  To use the G4AnalysisManager the source/analysis category
 must have been reconstructed with one of the environment
 variable setted :
    G4ANALYSIS_BUILD_OPEN_SCIENTIST
    G4ANALYSIS_BUILD_JAS

  To use an analysis system with this example, the coresponding
 environment variable must be setted :
    G4ANALYSIS_USE_OPEN_SCIENTIST
    G4ANALYSIS_USE_JAS

  Then to cosntruct this example :
    csh> cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/analysis/AnaEx01
    csh> setenv G4ANALYSIS_USE_OPEN_SCIENTIST 1
    csh> setenv G4ANALYSIS_USE_JAS 1
    csh> gmake
 
 Working with OpenScientist :
 --------------------------
  If working with OpenScientist run the program
 from the analysis/OpenScientist directory :
   csh> cd analyis/OpenScientist
   csh> $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/AnaEx01 OpenScientist
  It must produce a g4osc.root file that contains
 some histograms. You can visualize them with :
   csh> source <path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.csh
   csh> oxm
 and click in File/session to execute the session.tcl 
 file.

 Working with jas :
 --------------------------
  If working with jas :
   csh> cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/analysis/AnaEx01
   csh> $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/AnaEx01 jas
  The program will pend for a connection toward jas, then
 spawn jas :
   csh> <path_to_jas_bin>/jas

  From jas panel, open a connection toward the AnaEx01 job :
  - File/Reconnect
  - Give no server name if running on same machine.
  - Next to end the connect panel.

  When connection is established, the tree widget 
 on the left of jas panel must display "G4Job".
 Click on the tree items to access an histogram.
 Double click on the histogram name to visualize it.
 
  The histogram will update itself according time.
