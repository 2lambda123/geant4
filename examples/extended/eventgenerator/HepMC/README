                Examples for HepMC-Geant4 interface
                -----------------------------------

  This directory contains examples for using HepMC as an interface with 
various Monte Carlo event generators, such as PYTHIA. 

  HepMC is also currently part of CLHEP, but there are differences between
the original HepMC package and the one included in CLHEP in terms of the I/O.
Two examples are shown here: one for original HepMC and the other for the
CLHEP version (tagged with "-clhep").

Requirements for external software packages
-------------------------------------------
HepMC:
  tested version : 1.27.02
  http://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/spi/extsoft/packages.php?pkg=HepMC
  http://cern.ch/mdobbs/HepMC/

  Note: examples were tested only on Linux with gcc.

PYTHIA
  Tested version 6.205 (CERNLIB 2005)
  URL: http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html


What is provided
----------------
a) For the original HepMC

class HepMCG4Interface
  This class is derived from G4VPrimaryGenerator, and is a base class 
  for primary generation via HepMC object.

  protected members
  + virtual HepMC::GenEvent* GenerateHepMCEvent()
    Implement this method in his/her own concrete class.
    An empty event will be created in default.

  + void HepMC2G4(const HepMC::GenEvent* hepmcevt, G4Event* g4event)
    service method for conversion from HepMC::GenEvent to G4Event

  + virtual G4bool CheckVertexInsideWorld(const G4ThreeVector& pos) const
    We have to take care for the position of primaries because
    primary vertices outside the world volume give rise to G4Exception.
    If the default implementation is not adequate, an alternative 
    can be implemented in your own class.

  public members
  + virtual void GeneratePrimaryVertex(G4Event* anEvent)
    The default behavior is that a single HepMC event generated by
    GenerateHepMCEvent() will be converted to G4Event through HepMC2G4().

class HepMCG4AsciiReader / HepMCG4AsciiReaderMessenger
  (derived from HepMCG4Interface)
  This derived class is for reading primary information from 
  an Ascii file generated by HepMC.

class HepMCG4PythiaInterface / HepMCG4AsciiReaderMessenger
  (derived from HepMCG4Interface)
  This derived class is for directly calling PYTHIA functions. 
  Users can set parameters, initialize, generate, and terminate
  by command line operation.


b) For the CLHEP version of HepMC

  G4HepMCInterface, G4HepMCAsciiReader and G4HepMCAsciiReaderMessenger,
which have the same functionality as the above respective ones, are located
in the Geant4 "event/" source tree. As an example of interface with PYTHIA, 
the classes of HxxPythiaInterface/HxxPythiaMessenger are provided in each 
example.

Examples
--------
HepMCEx01/HepMCEx01-clhep
  This example is based on ExampleN04. Only part of the primary generator 
  action is replaced with new one.

HepMCEx02/HepMCEx02-clhep
  This is another example having the same generator action as HepMCEx01, 
  but much simpler user control.


Macros in examples
-----------------
hepmc_pygen.in
  process PYTHIA events(H->4mu) generated at every event.

hepmc_ascii.in
  read pregenerated events from HepMC Ascii file (data/example_MyPhyia.dat).

How to compile
--------------
To build HepMCEx01 and HepMCEx02 examples, the directory path where the
HepMC package is installed must be provided through the variable HEPMC_DIR.
PYTHIA 6.205 must be installed through CERNLIB 2005 and the bin path correctly
added in PATH.

Notes
-----
We attached a sample HepMC Ascii data file, "data/example_MyPhyia.dat",
which contains 10 PYTHIA events created by "data/example_MyPythia.cxx(cc)".
