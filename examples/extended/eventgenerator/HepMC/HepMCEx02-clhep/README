     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            HepMCEx02
                            ---------

  This example demonstrates how to interface primary particles in Geant4
with various event generators via the HepMC Monte Carlo event interface.
This is another example having the same generator action as HepMCEx01, 
but much simpler user control.

1. Primary Generator

 H02PrimaryGeneratorAction has G4HepMCInterface as the generator.
There are two types of generators provided as samples. One generator reads 
primary information from a HepMC Ascii file (data/example_MyPythia.dat).
The other one generates primaries directly invoking PYTHIA routines 
in every event.

2. Geometry

  A simplified collider-type geometry, which consists of 
    - endcap calorimeter (a set of tubes filled with lead), 
    - barrel calorimeter (tube filled with lead),
    - barrel muon detector (8 sets of plates filled with Ar),
    - endcap muon detecror, (a set of tubes filled with Ar) and
    - uniform magnetic field along the z axis of 3 Tesla at the 
      central region.

3. Physics List 

  Full set of "ordinary" physics processes, which is the same one as
ExN04PhysicsList.

4. User actions

  All particles except muons are killed in the calorimeter section.

NOTE: it requires the installation of CERNLIB 2005 in the system and proper
      access to the "/cern/pro/bin" path included in $PATH.
