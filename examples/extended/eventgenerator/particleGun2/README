 Divergent beam in an arbitrary direction.
 How to sample a tabulated function. 
 	
 1- Geometry construction
    ---------------------

 It is a simple box which represente an 'infinite' homogeneous medium.
  
 2- Physics list
    ------------

 PhysicsList.cc defines only geantino and transportation process.
         	
 3- Primary generator
    -----------------
 
 One shoots a geantino randomly uniform around a given direction (theta, phi).
 
 a) Energy spectrum
 Energy is sampled from a tabulated function defined in InitFunction().
 The function is assumed positive, linear per segment, continuous.
 Two sampling methods are illustrated : RejectAccept() and InverseCumul()
 (see Particle Data book, Monte Carlo techniques).
 Histogram 1 shows generated energy spectrum.
 
 c) Momentum direction
 One wants to limit particle direction uniformly around a given direction.
 First, one generates momentum direction in the master frame (eg. World).
 AlphaMax = opening angle around z axis.
 Then one rotates momentum in local frame, using rotateUz() function.
 RotateUz() transforms uz to newUz. It is composition of two simple rotations:
 theta around oy, then phi around oz (non commutative).

 Histograms 2-3 show momentum direction in local frame.
  	
 4- Visualisation
    -------------
 
 Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 Initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main 
 in case of interactive running mode.
 
 5- How to start ?
    --------------
 
  - compile and link to generate an executable
 	% cd gun
 	% gmake
 		
  - execute particleGun2 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% ParticleGun2   run1.mac
 		
  - execute particleGun2 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% particleGun2
 	....
 	Idle>      ---> type your commands. For instance:
	Idle> /run/beamOn 
	....
	Idle> /run/beamOn 10
	....				
 	Idle> exit
	
 6- Histograms
    ----------
 
  particleGun2 produces several 1D histograms which are saved as
  particleGun.root by default.

      1 : energy spectrum dN/dE = f(E)
      2 : momentum direction: angular distr dN/dOmega = f(alpha)
      3 : momentum direction: angular distr dN/dOmega = f(psi)      
            
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /testem/histo/setHisto id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /testem/histo/setFileName  name  (default particleGun)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file (hbook, root, XML)
   with the command /testem/histo/setFileType (root by default)
   
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /testem/histo/printHisto id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default particleGun) 

  Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
  the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.
 
  Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old files:
  	gmake histclean
  	gmake 

 7- Using histograms
    ---------------- 

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available. See the file InstallAida.txt
