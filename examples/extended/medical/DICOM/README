DICOM images are read and used as Geometry for simulations. 



In this version the method DicomHandler read the Data
contains in .dcm files and build a patient in the Geant4 environment (parametrised
G4Box)


2) The installation (Quick):

The program should be compiled in this directory, but it should be run in the bin
directory, because it needs to read several ASCII files for a correct run

The program has been successfully compiled and run on the following system :
	- Gentoo Linux 1.4-rc2 with gnu gcc 3.2.2 and geant4.5.0
	- Debian Linux 2.4.18-bf2 with gnu gcc 3.2.3 and geant4.5.0

3) Some details :

The DICOM images pixel values represent CT (Hounsfield) numbers and they should be
converted, first, to a given density and then to a material type.  The relation between
CT number and density is more or less linear.  The one used in this program is represented
in the table below.

Data taken from the International Commission on Radiation Units and measurements (ICRU)
report 46 was used to build the materials (lung, liver, breast, bones, ...)

For the example included, this is the correspondences used :
(see the image <informations/PhantomCT.jpg> for a visual example)

4) More informations :

For a more detailed explanation of the program, see the report(pdf) or the
power point presentation included in the folder <informations>. Both documents
are in french.
