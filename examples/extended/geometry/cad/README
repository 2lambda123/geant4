                     CAD STEP interface example 
                     --------------------------

This is an example using particle tracking in STEP CAD-models through
AP203 compliant STEP descriptions. The model can be changed by invoking
the UI command "/mydet/SelectDetector <model-name>", where
<model-name> is the name of the STEP file <model-name>.stp which
describes the detector geometry.
Due to limitations of the NIST STEP reader, a correct behavior can be
assured only for non-ISO/ANSI setup for the supported compilers as
specified in the notes for the SCL-3.2 package. Therefore, the GNUmakefile
in this example has been modified to force non-ISO/ANSI compilation on
Linux platforms.
AP203 STEP files showing errors in the reading process, can be formatted
using the PERL scripts provided in the "scripts" directory; most patterns
will be corrected. If errors are still observed, please inform us so that
the scripts can be enhanced.
