                         G3toG4 tool's example clGeometry
			 --------------------------------

This directory includes an application to demonstrate the usage of the
g3tog4 tool for converting Geant 3.21 simple geometries to Geant4 ones.

It requires Geant4 installation with G3toG4 library (
handled with GEANT4_USE_G3TOG4 option in CMake build or the G4LIB_USE_G3TOG4
environment variable in GNUmake build).

It demonstrates building a detector geometry using the call list
mechanism and also provides visualization. The name of the executable is
clGeometry.

The example uses several classes from the extended examples common repository 
(extended/common). When building the example separately from Geant4 installation,
both extended/common and extended/g3tog4 directories have to be copied to a user loal build
area.

To run the application, one must provide as input argument a call list file
(few test samples are placed in ../data), generated by the rztog4 application
which can be built typing "make bin" from $G4INSTALL/source/g3tog4.

clGeometry.in is a macro to be executed either interactively or in batch.

For example:
> cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/g3tog4/clGeometry
> clGeometry ../data/testmodel.dat clGeometry.in
