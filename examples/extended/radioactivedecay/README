        Geant4 extended examples - radioactive decay
        -------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate the use of some features of
RadioactiveDecay module.

RDecay1
-------

 This example allows to display basic features of the radioactive decay
 of a nuclei : energy spectrum of emitted particles, time of life, activity.

RDecay2
-------

 This example illustrates more advanced features of the package :
 selected decay channels, time window, bias and variance reduction technique.
