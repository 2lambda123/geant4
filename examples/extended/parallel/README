                        Examples for event parallelism
                        ------------------------------

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different techniques for achieving event parallelism with Geant4.

- ParN02 and ParN04 are modified versions of the novice examples N02 and N04
  adapted to be run together with the TOP-C communication layer application
  on either a cluster of systems or multi-processor machines.

- ExDiane is a simplified version of the advanced application "brachytherapy"
  showing how to run Geant4 in a parallel mode using DIANE (DIstributed
  ANalysis Environment).
