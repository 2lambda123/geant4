The files in this directory are the files that were used to build
 ../include/Marshaled*.hh .  The files ../include/Marshaled*.hh contain
marshaling (serialization) routines that are used by Parallel Geantr4.

Marshalgen is a package that allows one to add a small number of annotations
to the original sequential code, in order to create marshalling or
serialization routines.  Those marshalling routines are then used
by ParGeant4 to pass data between slave processes and the master process.

INPUT FILES:
1.  G4*.hh :  The files *.hh are taken from Geant4.  They include annotations
	(comments) that describe how to marshal individual fields of the
	given classes.  These files have additional annotations that describe
	how to marshal individual fields of the given classes.  You can reuse
	these files verbatim in any new Geant4 parallel application.	
2.  ../include/Ex*Hit.hh : These files are the original sequential Geant4
	application files that describe the application-defined hits.  
	For most new parallel Geant4 applications, these files are sufficiently
	simple, that the default behavior of Marshalgen will correctly
	create marshaling routines.  In such cases, you do _not_ have to
	write any code or annotations.
	    In exceptional cases, you may have to add by hand a small number
	of annotations for fields that Marshalgen does not correctly marshal.
	Information on how to do that comes with the Marshalgen package
	( http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/marshalgen ).
	

Marshalgen was then called on the above input files.  One calls:
  ./marshalgen *.hh
  ./marshalgen ../include/Ex*Hit.hh

OUTPUT FILES:
3.  *.msh : These files are intermediate files generated automatically
	by marshalgen  ( http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/marshalgen )
	These files can be deleted if desired.
4.  Marshaled*.h : These files are generated by Marshalgen.  They
	include of type both MarshaledEx*.h and MarshaledG4*.h .
	These files are copied to the include directory of the Geant4
	parallel application.  They provide the marshalling functions
	that are then used by Geant4.
