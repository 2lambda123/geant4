        Geant4 extended examples - run and event
        ----------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate the use of some features in
Run and Event categories. Since these categories are on the top of
hierarchy of Geant4 structure to control the full functionarities of
Geant4, some examples contain features in other categories such as
Tracking, Track, Particles, Detector responces, and even some cases
Geometry and Processes.

RE01
----

 This example demonstrates how to connect the information between
primary particles and hits. It also utilize some user-information 
classes.

RE02
----

 This example demonstrates how to accumulate the physics quantities
such as energy deposition and dose for a run. It also demonstrates
the use of primitive scorers.
