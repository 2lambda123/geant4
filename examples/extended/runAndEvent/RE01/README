 Contact : M.Asai (SLAC) 

1. Introduction

 This example demonstrates how to connect the information between
primary particles and hits. It also utilize some user-information
classes.

1.1 Geometry and region information

 It has a quite simple sylindrical tracker of 5 layers and a
sylindrical calorimeter of lead and scintillator. Dedicated regions
are assigned to both tracker and calorimeter mother volumes not
for setting additional production thresholds but for adding some
more information to these regions. RE01RegionInformation is the
class for this purpose.

1.2 Physics

 This example uses LHEP_BERT physics list. In addition to this,
RE01DecayPhysics is used for adding G4UnknownParticle and
G4UnknownDecay process.
