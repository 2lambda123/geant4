1. Introduction

 This example demonstrates how to use UI-command base scoring.
It create parallel world(s) for defining scoring mesh(es).

****************************************************************
* IMPORTANT NOTICE                                             *
*  This UI-command base scoring is still in alpha release and  *
* functionality offered is preliminary. We do not guarantee    *
* the correctness of the code. Also, we may change any of the  *
* commands / methods in the near future release.               *

1.1 Geometry and primary particle

 It has just one water box in the world volume filled by air.
No detector in the mass geometry. Particle gun shoots a gamma
into the water box.

1.2 Physics

 The physics list is mostly identical to exampleN03. It does not
have hadronics.

2. Macro files

 "run1.mac" through "run3.mac" macro files should be used 
independently. Each macro file create its own scoring parallel
world(s). "vis.mac" and "drawSlics.mac" are used internally.
Each macro should work for both interactively and batch, but
interactive mode is advised for better visualization.

3. RE03UserScoreWriter

 G4ScoringManager has a default score writer which dumps every
entry of one quantity of a mesh for all quantities of the mesh
one by one in CSV format. To alternate the file format the user
can implement his/her own score writer deriving from G4VUserScoreWriter
base class and set it to G4ScoringManager. To demonstrate this,
E03UserScoreWriter is included in this example. To use this
alternative writer, un-comment its instantiation in RE03.cc.
