                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

3rd May 2005  John Allison  (examples-V07-00-03)
- Replaced vis manager with G4VisExecutive.

March 17th, 2005 G.Daquino - B03-V07-00-00
- porting B03 from PI working with rh73 to PI working with slc3

Jun 20th, 2004  G.Daquino - B03-V06-01-00
- porting B03 from Anaphe (Lizard) to PI. Actually, PI 1.2.1 still DOES NOT
  allow the plotting in the same way, previously set in Anaphe. Therefore the
  HBOOk file produced at the end of the example still needs other packages to 
  be displayed. However, future PI releases could contain python modules with
  this property.
  README file has been updated accordingly.
