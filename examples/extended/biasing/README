                        Examples for event biasing
                        --------------------------

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different biasing techniques supported in Geant4, or possible from the user
applications.


General remark to biasing
-------------------------
The tools provided for importance sampling (or geometrical splitting and
Russian roulette) require the user to have a good understanding of the physics
in the problem. This is because the user has to decide which particle types 
have to be biased, define the regions (physical volumes, replicas) and 
assign importances to that regions. If this is not done properly the results
can not expected to describe a real experiment. 
The examples given here only demonstrate how to use the tools technically. They
don't intend to produce physical correct results.

General remark to scoring
-------------------------
A interface G4VPScorer is provided for the user. The user may create his own
class to perform the desired scoring. The user defined class therefore  
should inherit from the interface G4VPScorer. 
There are two example scorers G4PScorer and G4PIScorer provided. 
When scoring is done in a "scoring" or in a "importance" geometry
special action has to be taken to preferred counting of
"collisions" with boundaries of the tracking geometry as interactions.
This is different handled when scoring is done in the tracking geometry.
The scorers B01Scorer and B02Scorer show the difference in that case.
The Scorer B06Scorer checks for consistency of importance and weight.

Known problems
--------------
In the following scenario it can happen that a particle is not
biased and it's weight is therefore not changed even if it crosses
a boundary where biasing should happen.
The importance sampling creates particles on boundaries 
between volumes. If the GPIL method of a physical process returns 
0 as step length for a particle on a boundary and if the PostStepDoIt of
that process changes the direction of the particle to go back in the 
former volume the biasing won't be invoked. 
This will produce particles with weights that do not correspondent to the
importance of the current volumes.


I. Examples for scoring without biasing
=======================================

I. 1. Example B01
-----------------
This example shows how to  use scoring in the "tracking" geometry.
It scores several values for neutrons for every physical volume
in the tracking geometry. 
All scored values are printed after the running. In addition a more
exclusive output of selected values is printed. The way how the
last output is produced shows how to extract certain values from all
scored values.


I. 2. Example B02
-----------------
This example shows how to use scoring in a "parallel" or "scoring" geometry.
In this example a tracking and a scoring geometry is constructed. 
Gammas are scored in the scoring geometry. The scored values are dumped
to the screen after the run. How to access the score values more exclusively
is shown in example B01.


II. Examples for biasing without scoring
========================================

II. 1. Example B03
------------------
This example shows how to use biasing in the "tracking" geometry. 
It does not do scoring. 

II. 2. Example B04
------------------
This example shows how to use biasing according to a "parallel" 
or "importance" geometry.



III. Examples for biasing and scoring
=====================================

III. 1. Example B05
-------------------
Biasing and Scoring in the "tracking" geometry.

III. 2. Example B06
-------------------
Biasing and scoring in a "parallel" geometry.

III. 3. Example B07
-------------------
Biasing neutrons and gammas in a "parallel" geometry.
The physics list used in this example creates only processes for 
gammas and neutrons. Other particles that my be produce
will have no processes and can therefore not produce 
any particles.
The idea is to have the simulation performing somewhat like a transportation
Monte Carlo that only knows about neutrons and gammas and is only
used in limited energy range.
