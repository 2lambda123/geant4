                        Examples for event biasing
                        --------------------------

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different biasing techniques supported in Geant4, or possible from the user
applications.


General remark to biasing
-------------------------
The tools provided for importance sampling (or geometrical splitting and
Russiann roulett) require the user to have a good understanding of the physics
in the problem. This is because the user has to decide which particle types 
have to be biased, define the regions (physical volumes, replicas) and 
assign importances to that regions. If this is not done properly the rsults
can not expected to describe a real experiment. 
The examples given here only demonstrate how to use the tools tecnically. They
don't intend to produce physical correcxt results.

Known problems
--------------
In the following scenario it can happen that a particle is not
biased and it's weight is therefore not changed even if it crosses
a boundary where biasing should happen.
The importance sampling creates particles on boundaries 
between volumes. If the GPIL method of a physical process returns 
0 as step length for a particle on a boundary and if the PostStepDoIt of
that process changes the direction of the particle to go back in the 
former volume the biasing won't be invoked. 
This will produce particles with weights that do not coresspondend to the
importance of the current volumes.


I. Examples for scoring without biasing
=======================================

I. 1. Example B01
-----------------
This example shows the use of scoring in the "tracking" geometry.
It scores several values for neutrons for evry physical volume
in the tracking geometry. 
All scored values are printed after the running. In addition a more
exclusive output of selected values is printed. The way how the
last ouput is produced shows how to extract certain values from all
scored values.


I. 2. Example B02
-----------------
This example shows the use of scoring in a "parallel" or "scoring" geometry.
In this example a tracking and a scoring geometry is constructed. 
Gammas are scored in the scoring geometry. The scored values are dumped
to the screen after the run. How to access the score values more exclusively
is shown in example B01.


II. Examples for biasing without scoring
========================================

II. 1. Example B03
------------------
This example shows the use of biasing in the "tracking" geometry. 
It does not do scoring. 

II. 2. Example B04
------------------
This example shows the use of biasing according to a "parallel" or "importance"
geometry.
