                        Examples for event biasing
                        --------------------------

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different biasing techniques supported in Geant4, or possible from the 
user applications.


General remark to biasing
-------------------------
The tools provided for importance sampling (or geometrical splitting and
Russian roulette) require the user to have a good understanding of the 
physics in the problem. This is because the user has to decide which 
particle types have to be biased, define the regions (physical volumes, 
replicas) and assign importances to that regions. If this is not done 
properly it can not be expected that the results describe a real 
experiment. The examples given here only demonstrate how to use the tools
technically. They don't intend to produce physical correct results.

General remark to scoring
-------------------------
A interface G4VPScorer is provided for the user. The user may create his 
own class to perform the desired scoring. The user defined class 
therefore should inherit from the interface G4VPScorer. 
An example of an implementation of a scorer is G4StandardScorer
which may be found in source/run. 
The scoring in these examples is done with a G4StandardScorer.
When scoring is done in a "scoring" or in a "importance" geometry
special action has to be taken to prevent counting of
"collisions" with boundaries of the tracking geometry as interactions.
This is differently handled when scoring is done in the tracking geometry.

Known problems
--------------
In the following scenario it can happen that a particle is not
biased and it's weight is therefore not changed even if it crosses
a boundary where biasing should happen.
The importance sampling creates particles on boundaries 
between volumes. If the GPIL method of a physical process returns 
0 as step length for a particle on a boundary and if the PostStepDoIt of
that process changes the direction of the particle to go back in the 
former volume the biasing won't be invoked. 
This will produce particles with weights that do not correspondent to the
importance of the current volumes.
