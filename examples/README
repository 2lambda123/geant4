     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                         Examples module
                         ---------------

This module collects three sets of user examples aimed to demonstrate to
the user how to make correct use of the GEANT4 toolkit by implementing
in a correct way those user-classes which the user is supposed to
customize in order to define his/her own simulation setup.
One set of examples is oriented to "novice" users and covering all
possible general use-cases typical of an "application"-oriented kind of
development. An "Extended" set of examples require some additional
libraries besides of Geant4. This set covers some realistic use cases
for actual detector simulation for HEP. An "advanced" set of examples 
(not yet available at the current time), will cover the use-cases typical 
of a "toolkit"-oriented kind of development.
Most of the examples can be run both in interactive and batch mode, and 
input macro files (*.in) and reference output files (*.out) are provided.
These examples are considered part of the validation procedure for the
official releases of the GEANT4 toolkit, as "acceptance"-testing phase
of the validation process.
