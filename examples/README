     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                         Examples module
                         ---------------

This module collects two sets of user examples aimed to demonstrate to
the user how to make correct use of the GEANT4 toolkit by implementing
in a correct way those user-classes which the user is supposed to
customize in order to define his/her own simulation setup.
One set of examples is oriented to "novice" users and covering all
possible general use-cases typical of an "application"-oriented kind of
development. An "advanced" set of examples (not yet available at the
current time), will cover the use-cases typical of a "toolkit"-oriented
kind of development.
Most of the examples can be run both in interactive and batch mode, and 
input macro files (*.in) and reference output files (*.out) are provided.
These examples are considered part of the validation procedure for the
official releases of the GEANT4 toolkit, as "acceptance"-testing phase
of the validation process.
