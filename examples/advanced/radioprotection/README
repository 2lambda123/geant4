0. Introduction.

Radioprotection example simulates energy deposition in the healthy lobe
of thyroid after the submission of I-131 tabloid for metabolic therapy.

1. Technical description

1.0. I-131 tabloid  is  submitted in the patient for  metabolic therapy. 
This therapy takes advantage from  the radioemmision of I-131 and from the 
capabilty,for the patological nodule, to metabolize the most of I-131.
This nodule (approximated as a sphere) is the source; and is constructed 
in the ThyroidDetectorConstruction class. The source is composed by I-131
omogeneusly distribuited in all the nodule.

1.1. The water cilynder (the neck and world volume) is made sensitive detector. 
At every hit energy deposition is read and stored into a "Thyroid.out" file.

1.2. Visualizaion with was improved

2. Make

A standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile is provided.

2. Usage

Simply run "Thyroid" executable. The ASCII "Thyroid.out" file is
produced.

N.B.: actual version is still to debug, work is in progress
