0. Introduction.

The Radioprotection example derives from a Geant4 application
 ( look www.ge.infn.it/space/remsim for more details ) whose scope 
is to evaluate the dose in astronauts, in vehicle concepts and 
Moon surface habitat configurations, in a given interplanetary space radiation 
environment. 

1. GEOMETRY

The user can calculate the dose in the astronaut (phantom) in the
following set-ups:

- Vehicle configuration

      | ||sh|   |    |     |       | 
      |S||ie|   |SPE |     |       |
----> |I||ld|   |she |     |phantom|
beam  |H||in|   |lter|     |       |
      | ||g |   |    |     |       |
                            
--------------------------------------->
                                      Z axis

- The SIH is the Simplified Inflatable Habitat. 

- The shielding is  a layer of water, its scope it to protect the astronaut 
  from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The user can add, delete this element
  in the geometrical configuration, change its thickness through UI comands.

- The SPE shelter is a water layer (thickness = 75.cm along Z axis), its scope 
  it to protect the astronaut from Solar Particle Events (SPE).
  The user can add, delete this element in the geometrical configuration
  through UI comands.

- The phantom is the astronaut model; the energy deposit is collected in this
  geometrical component. The phantom is a box of water,
  it is 30. cm wide along Z axis, it is voxelised in 30 slices along Z axis. 
  The energy deposit of primary and secondary particles is collected in 
  each voxel.

- Moon Habitat configuration

------------------------------------------->
                                         Z axis
                     
- The astronaut/phantom is set in the astronaut habitat (shelter) on 
  the Moon Surface.

- The pyramid log is made of moon soil and protects the astronaut from 
  GCR and SPE. The user can add, delete this element in the geometrical 
  configuration, change its thickness through UI comands. The user can 
  change the thickness x.

- The phantom is the astronaut model; the energy deposit is collected in this
  geometrical component. The phantom is a box of water,
  it is 30. cm wide along Z axis, it is voxelised in 30 slices along Z axis. 
  The energy deposit of primary and secondary particles is collected in 
  each voxel.

The primary particles can be generated with different conditions as explained 
in section 3.

1.1 UI

- The user can change the geometry set-up with the following UI commands:
/configuration/choose vehicle -> choose the Vehicle configuration
/configuration/choose moon    -> choose the Moon Habitat configuration
The user can not switch between these two configurations interactively.

- The user can select in the vehicle configuration:
/configuration/AddShielding On   -> set the shielding water layer
/configuration/AddShielding Off  -> destroy the shielding water layer
/shielding/thickness 30.cm       -> set the thickness of the shielding layer
/configuration/AddSPE On         -> set the SPE shelter
/configuration/AddSPE Off        -> destroy the SPE shelter

- The user can select in the Moon surface habitat configuration:
/configuration/AddRoof On   -> set the pyramid log
/configuration/AddRoof Off  -> destroy the pyramid log
/roof/thickness 1. m        -> set the height (x) of the pyramid log

2. PHYSICS LIST

The user can select the physics processes to activate interactively as 
shown in the macro vis.mac.
The example is provided of:
- Low Energy electromagnetic processes for photons, e- 
- Standard electromagnetic processes for e+
- Low Energy  electromagnetic processes with ICRU parameterisation 
  for p, alpha and ions
- Muon electromagnetic processes
- Decay
- Hadronic processes for p and alpha particles as primary particles.

3. PRIMARY PARTICLES

The user can select different set-ups to generate primary particles:

- "Basic": monochromatic particle beam (default configuration)

- "Interplanetary": particle beam with energy derived from a given 
  energy spectrum. The primary vertex and the direction are fixed.

- "Moon": particles generated with energy derived from a given 
  energy spectrum; The primary vertex is generated on a given hemisphere.

The energy spectrum is written is ASCII file:
first column: energy in MeV
second column: flux
The final two rows must look as follows:
-1 -1
-2 -2

The flux is used as probability of generating a particle with a particular 
energy. The sum of the fluxes is normalised to 1 in the RunAction. 

Examples of ASCII files --

- Galactic Cosmic Rays fluxes (envelope of CREME96 1977 and CREME86 1975 solar
minimum spectra):

p: gcrZ=1.txt
alpha: gcrZ=2.txt
carbon ion: gcrZ=6.txt
oxygen ion: gcrZ=8.txt
silicon ion: gcrZ=14.txt
iron ion: gcrZ=26.txt
The ions are completly stripped.

- Solar Particle Events (envelope of CREME96 October 1989 and 
August 1972 spectra)

p: speZ=1.txt
alpha: speZ=2.txt

3.1 UI
The user can define primary particles with the following command:
/gun/particle proton
/gun/particle alpha
/gun/particle IonC12
/gun/particle IonO16
/gun/particle IonSi28
/gun/particle IonFe52

The user can select interactively the configuration with the following
UI commands:
/gun/generator Basic
/gun/energy Interplanetary
/gun/generator Moon

4. STEPPING

Available UI command:

/step/hadronicVerbose On  -> print the hadronic processes undertaken by 
                             particles during the run

/step/hadronicVerbose Off -> switch off the verbose level

5. ANALYSIS

if ANALYSIS_USE = 1 in the variable environment, the output of
the simulation is remsim.hbk           
                                 
The file contains histograms:                                              
    - 10 (1)   Energy Deposit (MeV)in the phantom (astronaut) versus 
               the depth along Z axis 
    
    - 20 (1)   Initial energy (MeV) of primary particles               
    
    - 30 (1)   Energy Deposit (MeV) in the phantom given by secondaries  
               versus the depth along Z axis 
    
    - 40 (1)   Initial energy (MeV) of primaries reaching the phantom  
    
    - 50 (1)   Initial energy (MeV) of primaries ougoing the phantom 
     
    - 60 (1)   Energy (MeV) of primaries reaching the phantom          
     
    - 70 (1)   Energy (MeV) of primaries outgoing the phantom
