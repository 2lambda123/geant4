0. INTRODUCTION

The Radioprotection example derives from a Geant4 application
 ( look www.ge.infn.it/geant4/space/remsim for more details ) whose scope 
is to evaluate the dose in astronauts, in vehicle concepts and 
Moon surface habitat configurations, in a defined interplanetary space
radiation environment. 

1. GEOMETRY

The user can calculate the dose in the astronaut (phantom) in the
following set-ups:

- Vehicle configuration

      | ||sh|   |    |     |       | 
      |S||ie|   |SPE |     |       |
----> |I||ld|   |she |     |phantom|
beam  |H||in|   |lter|     |       |
      | ||g |   |    |     |       |
                            
--------------------------------------->
                                      Z axis

- The SIH is the Simplified Inflatable Habitat. 

- The shielding is  a layer of water, its scope it to protect the astronaut 
  from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The user can add, delete this element
  in the geometrical configuration, change its thickness through UI comands.

- The SPE shelter is a water layer (thickness = 75.cm along Z axis), its scope 
  it to protect the astronaut from Solar Particle Events (SPE).
  The user can add, delete this element in the geometrical configuration
  through UI comands.

- The phantom is the astronaut model; the energy deposit is collected in this
  geometrical component. The phantom is a box of water,
  it is 30. cm wide along Z axis, it is voxelised in 30 slices along Z axis. 
  The energy deposit of primary and secondary particles is collected in 
  each voxel.

- Moon Habitat configuration

------------------------------------------->
                                         Z axis
                     
- The astronaut/phantom is set in the astronaut habitat (shelter).

- The pyramid log is made of moon soil and protects the astronaut from 
  GCR and SPE. The user can add, delete this element in the geometrical 
  configuration, change its thickness (x) through UI comands. 

- The phantom is the astronaut model; the energy deposit is collected in this
  geometrical component. The phantom is a box of water,
  it is 30. cm wide along Z axis, it is voxelised in 30 slices along Z axis. 
  The energy deposit of primary and secondary particles is collected in 
  each voxel.

1.1 UI

- The user can change the geometry set-up with the following UI commands:
/configuration/choose vehicle -> choose the Vehicle configuration
/configuration/choose moon    -> choose the Moon Habitat configuration
The user can not switch between these two configurations interactively.

- The user can select in the vehicle configuration:
/configuration/AddShielding On   -> set the shielding water layer
/configuration/AddShielding Off  -> destroy the shielding water layer
/shielding/thickness 30.cm       -> set the thickness of the shielding layer
/configuration/AddSPE On         -> set the SPE shelter
/configuration/AddSPE Off        -> destroy the SPE shelter

- The user can select in the Moon surface habitat configuration:
/configuration/AddRoof On   -> set the pyramid log
/configuration/AddRoof Off  -> destroy the pyramid log
/roof/thickness 1. m        -> set the height (x) of the pyramid log

2. PHYSICS LIST

The user can select the physics processes to activate interactively as 
shown in the macro vis.mac.
The example is provided of:
- Low Energy electromagnetic processes for photons, e- 
- Standard electromagnetic processes for e+
- Low Energy electromagnetic processes with ICRU parameterisation 
  for p, alpha and ions
- Muon electromagnetic processes
- Decay
- Hadronic processes for p and alpha particles as primary particles.

The user can choose the Bertini cascade approach or the
 binary cascade approach for the modeling of proton hadronic physics.

3. PRIMARY PARTICLES
Primary particles are generated through the General Particle Source.
Galactic Cosmic Protons (CREME 96) are generated from a point set in 
the position (0., 0., -25. m), with a direction (0., 0., 1.) by default.
The energy spectrum of the primary particles follows the 
differential energy distribution described in gcrZ=1gps.mac.
The user can change these parameters interactively.

4. STEPPING

Available UI command:

/step/hadronicVerbose On  -> print the hadronic processes undertaken by 
                             particles during the run

/step/hadronicVerbose Off -> switch off the verbose level

5. ANALYSIS

if ANALYSIS_USE = 1 in the variable environment, the output of
the simulation is remsim.hbk or remsim.xml.
The default output file is remsim.hbk. 
The user can change the format of the output file interactively as shown
in section 5.1
                                 
The file contains histograms:                                              
    - 10 (1)   Energy Deposit (MeV)in the phantom (astronaut) versus 
               the depth along Z axis 
    
    - 20 (1)   Initial energy per nucleon (MeV) of primary particles               
    
    - 30 (1)   Energy Deposit (MeV) in the phantom given by secondaries  
               versus the depth along Z axis 
    
    - 40 (1)   Initial energy (MeV) of primaries reaching the phantom  
    
    - 50 (1)   Initial energy (MeV) of primaries ougoing the phantom 
     
    - 60 (1)   Energy (MeV) of primaries reaching the phantom          
     
    - 70 (1)   Energy (MeV) of primaries outgoing the phantom

    - 80 (2)   Project the coordinate of the hits on the plane xy
  
    - 90 (2)   Project the  energy  deposit of the hits on the plane xy
