23th November 2005 Susanna Guatelli (radioprotection-V07-01-02)
- Ions introduced

23th November 2005 Susanna Guatelli (radioprotection-V07-01-01)
- Deleted warning due to standard C++ libraries concerning reading 
external files
- Added Eta and EtaPrime as particles

8th September 2005  Susanna Guatelli  (radioprotection-V07-01-00)
- Deleted bug. The bug appears at the end of the execution of the simulation.
  The bug consists in a segmentation fault appearing after the delete
  of the run manager. The bug appeared with platform slc3.
  It is due to a bug in G4hLowEnergyIonisation.

- Code review, analysis with AIDA 3.2.1 and PI 1.3.3

3rd May 2005  John Allison  (examples-V07-00-03)
- Replaced vis manager with G4VisExecutive.

11.2004 - Binary cascade approach added

11.2004 - Option to define the format of the output file hbook or xml

11.2004 - Add histograms 
 
05.2004 - Design iteration with Decorator Design pattern

01.2004 - S.Guatelli
