This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

				    human_phantom-V08-01-02
- Geantino introduced as primary particles
- MIRD model is hard-coded
- ORNL model is defined through GDML files  
- No overlapping volumes
- Translation for the legs is set to:x="-7.01" y="-39.1" z="0"
  instead of x="-7." y="-39." z="0", to avoid volume overlaps
- Review of the code
- Design iteration

- UI with command defining
-- Sex of Phantom
-- Model pf Phantom
-- Name of body part to be built and their sensitivity
