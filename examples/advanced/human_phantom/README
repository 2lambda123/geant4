------> Introduction

The human_phantom example models anthropomorphic phantoms for Geant4 simulations.
Two models are available: MIRD [1]and ORNL [2] (Male and Female).

for monoenergetic photon sources uniformly distributed in various organs of a heterogeneous phantom",
J. Nucl. Med. Suppl., no. 3, pp. 5-52, 1969.

 photon sources", ORNL/TM-8381/VI, Apr. 1987.
 
Authors: S. Guatelli (guatelli@ge.infn.it) and M. G. Pia (pia@ge.infn.it), INFN Genova, Italy
 
The example is based on code developed by the undergraduate student G. Guerrieri 
Note: this is a preliminary beta-version of the code; an improved 
version will be distributed in the next Geant4 public release, compliant
with the design in a forthcoming publication, and subject to a design and code review.

-----> Geometry 

The process of building a phantom is handled through the Builder design pattern.
The creation of coherent models of the human phantom is handled through an Abstract Factory design pattern.

The organs of the MIRD phantom are implemented in hard-code; the organs of the ORNL phantom 
are handled through GDML (Geometry Description Markup Language, www.cern.ch/gdml).

// Parameterized breast

Bug report: #914

-----> Physics

Particles: e-, e+, photon, geantino
Physics list: electromagnetic processes are active for photons, e- and e+
The threshold of production of secondary particles is set to 0.1 * mm.


-----> Primary particles

The primary particles are geantino.


-----> Energy deposit

The energy deposit is calculated in the organs of the phantom.
At the end of the execution of the simulation  the summary of the total energy deposit in each organ is print out.
The user can set the sensitivity of each organ interactively with the UI command:
/bodypart/addBodyPart organName yes
(see adultFemale.mac as example)

-----> Analysis


-----> Setup

- Install the GDML package with Geant4 extensions and Xerces.
  See: http://cern.ch/gdml.

- Set the environment variable GDML_BASE to point to the area where
  GDML is installed. Specify the system architecture with SCRAM_ARCH.
  Set XERCESCROOT to point to place where Xerces is installed.
  You can also edit the GNUmakefile provided with the example and
  customise it for your specific setup.

- Customize the '*.gdml' schema file, specifying in the top line the
  right path where to retrieve the main GDML schema file (step that will
  become automatic in future).

- Compile and link to generate an executable:
 	      % gmake
 		
- Execute the application:
 	      % phantom
	 
- Default macro: adultFemale.mac (MIRD, Female model) 
- Other macros:  adultMale.mac (MIRD, Male model)
                 adultORNLFemale.mac (ORNL, Female model)
                 adultORNLMale.mac (ORNL, Male model)
- Visualization macros: vrmlVis.mac, dawnVis.mac, openGLVis.mac, noVis.mac
- Run particles: run.mac
