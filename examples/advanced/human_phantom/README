                          Anthropomorphic Phantom
                          -----------------------

Anthropomorphic Phantom is built through use of GDML file. It allows
to export geometry descriptions of body parts in an application independent 
format (GDML, Geometry Description Markup Language).
The GDML files can be then used to interchange geometries between different
applications and users.

The phantom construction consists of creation of a GDML file, through specification
about sex of phantom, which body part build and in which model (MIRD, ORNL, MIX).
Then construction consist of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses the
GDML file (userPhantom.gdml) and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user
can also write his/her own GDML file and use it as the primary input format for
his/her Geant4 application.


HOW TO BUILD THE PHANTOM ?

- Install the GDML package with Geant4 extensions and Xerces.
  See: http://cern.ch/gdml.

- Set the environment variable GDML_BASE to point to the area where
  GDML is installed. Specify the system architecture with SCRAM_ARCH.
  Set XERCESCROOT to point to place where Xerces is installed.
  You can also edit the GNUmakefile provided with the example and
  customise it for your specific setup.

- Customise the 'userPhantom.gdml' schema file, specifying in the top line the
  right path where to retrieve the main GDML schema file (step that will
  become automatic in future).

- Compile and link to generate an executable:
 	      % gmake
 		
- Execute the application:
 	      % phantom adultFemale.mac (adultMale.mac)
	(default choice: openGL visualisator
	 others macros: vrmlVis.mac, dawnVis.mac, openGLVis.mac, noVis.mac)
