                          Anthropomorphic Phantom
                          -----------------------

Anthropomorphic Phantom body parts are built through use of GDML file. 
The format (GDML, Geometry Description Markup Language) can be then used 
to interchange geometries between different applications and users.

The phantom construction, through specification
about sex of phantom, which body part build and in which model (MIRD, ORNL, MIX),
consist of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses the
GDML file (i.e. MIRDStomach.gdml) and returns the pointer to the world volume. 
The user can write his own GDML file to describe single body part.


HOW TO BUILD THE PHANTOM ?

- Install the GDML package with Geant4 extensions and Xerces.
  See: http://cern.ch/gdml.

- Set the environment variable GDML_BASE to point to the area where
  GDML is installed. Specify the system architecture with SCRAM_ARCH.
  Set XERCESCROOT to point to place where Xerces is installed.
  You can also edit the GNUmakefile provided with the example and
  customise it for your specific setup.

- Customize the '*.gdml' schema file, specifying in the top line the
  right path where to retrieve the main GDML schema file (step that will
  become automatic in future).

- Compile and link to generate an executable:
 	      % gmake
 		
- Execute the application:
 	      % phantom
	(default choice: adultFemale.mac 
	 other: adultMale.mac
	 visualizators: vrmlVis.mac, dawnVis.mac, openGLVis.mac, noVis.mac
	 run particle: run.mac)

- For the Adult Male phantom: modify G4HumanPhantomBuilder.cc at lines 60/61 (for the sex definition) 
  and lines 69 and ss. for the Body part construction.
