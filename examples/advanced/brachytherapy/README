0. Introduction.

Brachytherapy example simulates energy deposition on a voxel grid
for a MicroSelectron Ir-192 HDR brachytherapy source.

1. Technical description

1.0. MicroSelectron HDR Ir-192 source is constructed in the 
brachyDetectorConstruction class. The source is composed by
an iridium core encapsulated in a stainless steel capsule 
(body + tip). The source is put into a 30*cm water box.

1.1. The water box is made sensitive detector. A longitudinal slice
of it is associated to a planar read out geometry. At every hit
energy deposition is read and stored into a voxel matrix.

1.2. Voxel matrix is output to an ASCII file for further processing
(e.g. anysotropy and isodose calculations).

2. Make

A standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile is provided.

2. Usage

Simply run "Brachy" executable. The ASCII "Brachy.out" file is
produced.
