Example description:

This is example is based on simulations of the instrumental background
of the eROSITA X-ray telescope, in particular the strength of
fluorescence lines inside the passive graded Z shield. The set-up
considered in this example consists of a Cu block that is irradiated
with protons. Impact ionization of Cu atoms generates vacancies in
atomic shells. These are then filled by atomic de-excitation,
resulting in the emission of fluorescence photons and Auger electrons
- the PIXE (particle induced X-ray emission) process. In particular
fluorescence photons are then detected with a Si CCD positioned next to
the Cu block.
