UNDERGROUND PHYSICS

An example of a underground dark matter example.

Physics included:




Timescale for completion by 30th November:
TO DO:

Test on multiple platforms SUN platform - so far tested with egcs and g++.

Also add Analysis and possibly
Digits+Hits

Documentation

Include cavern rock outside of your "wall"

Analysis - will make validation easier

Random engine - from extended example?

Seeds handling

Caveats:

G4NeutronHPNames.cc needs modification/bug-fix - place
G4NeutronHPNames.cc_required in
$G4INSTALL/source/processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp/src
as G4NeutronHPNames.cc and re-make neutron_hp and then libmap


Am241 running:
G4RadiativeDecayData has to add file z95.a241
To use it you will have first to make a small change to the file
G4NucleusLimits.cc in the 
source/processes/hadronics/model/radiative_decay/src directory. At the
moment the upper limit for the applicable nucleus is A=240. You need to
change this to, say, 250 and rebuild the lib.


NB:
If using explicit libraries (?) i.e. non-shared then compilation time with
neutrons in physics list is very long (>5 minutes) - check this.............
It is more efficient to use shared libraries that are loaded at run-time with
increased initialisation time (at run-time).

Also if using shared libraries the load time at run-time may be several minutes
- this is partially due to the neutron implementation requires full data sets
for each isotope being specified.


--------------------------------------

If running on Redhat 7.0 or above set G4SYSTEM to Linux-g++, alternatively you
can install backward compatibility to egcs, however, requires
config/sys/Linux-egcs.gmk to be altered so that CXX is set to kgcc 
(compared to g++ in original file)

--------------------------------------

Physics checking:

A very easy way to check which processes are assigned to what
 is to do

   /particle/select e-
   /particle/process/dump -1


 2. RDM

 apart from the changes to 
 /processes/hadronic/models/radiative_decay/src/G4NucleusLimits.cc

 we also need to change
 /hadronic/models/generator/de_excitation/src/G4DiscreteGammaDeexcitation.cc
 to include Am241 as a discrete deexcitation (change to A,Z limits again)
 - i.e. change Z>92 to Z>95

committed to CVS 27/11/01
