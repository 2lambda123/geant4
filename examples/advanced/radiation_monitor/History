25 Nov 2005 - radmon-V07-01-12 - R. Capra - Analysis framework completed 
                        hadronic physics implemented. First analysis module
                        implemented.

24 Nov 2005 - radmon-V07-01-11 - R. Capra - Development of the analysis
                        code. Framwork partially completed. Sensitive
                        detectors not linked to Geometry yet.
                        RadmonAnalysis methods have a dummy implementation.
                        Introduced changes are:
                        - Analysis code (partial)
                        - Tracks display
                        - Event/Run number dump
                        - Small corrections (grammar, comments)
                        - RadmonPhysicsList::OnLayoutChange behaviur changed
                          (better performances)
                        - Macros updated according to current developments
                        Code builds and runs. Analysis stuff still not
                        completely working.

07 Nov 2005 - radmon-V07-01-10 - R. Capra - Development of the physics list

                        Default macros for beam and physics defined
                        
                        Code builds, test in progress

07 Nov 2005 - radmon-V07-01-09 - R. Capra - Development of the physics list
                        code:
                        - RadmonPhysicsDummyPhysicsList class removed

                        Code builds, but not tested yet. Physics list still
                        to be implemented

25 Oct 2005 - radmon-V07-01-08 - R. Capra - Development of the particle
                        generator according to the design:

                        - Minor changes in the detector package.
                        - RadmonApplication has been splietted into classes
                          for management purposes and in order to improve
                          the compilation time and dependencies.
                        - Completely new generator package with a design
                          similar to the detector one.

                        Code builds. Primary generator code not tested yet.

24 Oct 2005 - radmon-V07-01-07 - R. Capra - Design iteration: classes:

14 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-02 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. RadmonDetectorMessenger completed 
                        and tested. Needs still some work on detector
                        construction and materials. The code runs. Creation
                        of the physics subpackage. This tag is only for

12 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-01 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. RadmonDetectorLayout completed
                        Needs still some work Messenger and detector
                        construction and materials . The code does not run
                        but should build. This tag is only for backup
                        purposes

09 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-00 - R. Capra - Internal subdirectories created
                        and GNUmakefile(s). Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. The code does not builds.
