07 Mar 2006  - radmon-V08-00-02 - S. Fonseca - Change limits of the  LENeutronInelastic for 0.1 GeV in RadmonPhysicsNeutronBertini and RadmonPhysicsNeutronBinary class.

05 Mar 2006 - radmon-V08-00-01 - S. Fonseca - Introduced new results with proton  of 254MeV, 150 Mev and 50 Mev of energy. New macros added with new material Kapton(It still was not tested)

03 Jan 2006 - radmon-V08-00-00-RC - R. Capra - Few macros added in order to
                        reproduce first run results

06 Dec 2005 - radmon-V07-01-14 - R. Capra - Documentation extended README
                        file now covers all the aspects of the application
                        in great details. Small changes in RadmonApplication
                        and RadmonApplicationAnalysisSetup so that when
                        G4ANALYSIS_USE is not set, code builds without
                        analysis. RadmonPhysicsList changed in order to
                        manage particles changes present from tag
                        geant4-08-00-cand01. Stepping action added in order
                        to manage these changes. Errors present in
                        RadmonPhysicsHadronsBertini, RadmonPhysicsDecay,
                        RadmonPhysicsICRUIonization corrected. The error
                        present in RadmonPhysicsHadronsBertini caused the
                        application crash. The error present in
                        RadmonPhysicsDecay, RadmonPhysicsICRUIonization
                        caused a not true warning message appear.
