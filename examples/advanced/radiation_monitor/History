25 Oct 2005 - radmon-V07-01-08 - R. Capra - Development of the particle
                        generator according to the design:

                        - Minor changes in the detector package.
                        - RadmonApplication has been splietted into classes
                          for management purposes and in order to improve
                          the compilation time and dependencies.
                        - Completely new generator package with a design
                          similar to the detector one.

                        Code builds. Primary generator code not tested yet.

24 Oct 2005 - radmon-V07-01-07 - R. Capra - Design iteration: classes:
                        
                        - RadmonVDetectorLayoutObserver
                        - RadmonVDetectorLayoutSubject
                        - RadmonDetectorLayoutEntityWithAttributes
                        
                        has been moved in generalPurpose package without the
                        Detector suffix. They will be used for the primary
                        generator too.

30 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-06 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design. The layer with pads needed for detectors
                        layout has been now implemented.
                        Macros to generate the real packaging geometry has
                        been provided.

27 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-05 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design. All the packaging layers are now
                        implemented.  Trasparency support (alpha channel)
                        has been provided.

21 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-04 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design almost completed. Following functionality
                        added:
                        - Alpha channel support for attributes
                        - Carved geometry decorator
                        - Hole geometry decorator

19 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-03 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. Following functionality added:
                        - Materials creation through a messenger
                        - Geometry creation and update
                        - First Geometry constructor object created (Simple
                          box)
                        - Macros directory created

14 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-02 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. RadmonDetectorMessenger completed 
                        and tested. Needs still some work on detector
                        construction and materials. The code runs. Creation
                        of the physics subpackage. This tag is only for

12 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-01 - R. Capra - Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. RadmonDetectorLayout completed
                        Needs still some work Messenger and detector
                        construction and materials . The code does not run
                        but should build. This tag is only for backup
                        purposes

09 Sep 2005 - radmon-V07-01-00 - R. Capra - Internal subdirectories created
                        and GNUmakefile(s). Implementation according to the
                        design in progress. The code does not builds.
