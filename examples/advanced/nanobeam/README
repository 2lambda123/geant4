---->1. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The nanobeam example simulates the beam optics of the nanobeam line installed 
on the AIFIRA electrostatic accelerator facility located at CENBG, 
Bordeaux-Gradignan, France. For more information on this facility, 
please visit :
http://www.cenbg.in2p3.fr/

The code can be used to calculate : 
1) intrinsic aberration coefficients of the nanobeam line
2) beam image from a relasitic primary emittance distribution
3) grid shadow images

Three quadrupole field models can be used :
- a simple square field model
- a 3D mesh field model computed from OPERA3D
- an analytical model based on Enge's model

---->2. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
 
The full magnetic configuration of the nanobeam line is simulated.
This configuration is made of a combination of a doublet and triplet of 
5 Oxford Microbeams Ltd. OM50 quadrupoles. 

More details on the experimental setup and its simulation with Geant4 can 
be found in the following papers, which may be found on the SLAC-SPIRES
online database (http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/) :

---->3. SET-UP 
                                                                        
- a standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile is provided                     

setup with:                                                             
compiler = gcc-3.4.6
G4SYSTEM = linux-g++                                                    

The following section gives the necessary environment variables.                     

------->>3.1  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

All variables are defined with their default value.

 - G4SYSTEM = Linux-g++

 - G4INSTALL              points to the installation directory of GEANT4;

 - G4LIB                  point to the compiled libraries of GEANT4;

 - G4WORKDIR              points to the work directory;

 - CLHEP_BASE_DIR         points to the installation directory of CHLEP; 

 - G4LEDATA               points to the low energy electromagnetic libraries;

 - LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $CLHEP_BASE_DIR/lib

 - G4LEVELGAMMADATA       points to the photoevaporation library;

 - G4NEUTRONHPDATA	  points to the neutron data files;

 - G4RADIOACTIVEDATA      points to the libraries for radio-active decay 
                          hadronic processes;
 
 - G4ABLADATA		  points to the libraries fo ablation processes;

However, the $G4LEVELGAMMADATA, $G4NEUTRONHPDATA, $G4RADIOACTIVEDATA
and $G4ABLADATA
variables do not need to be defined for this example.

Once these variables have been set, simply type gmake to compile the Nanobeam
example. 

------->>3.2  VISUALIZATION

Visualization has not been implemented. 
All results are stored in text files and can be displayed with the provided
ROOT macro file plot.C. 

This macro file shows :
- the beam profile along the nanobeam line (only for the computation of intrinsic 
  coefficients)
- the beam image (Y vs X) on target
- the beam emittance (THETA vs X) and (PHY vs Y) on target
- the grid shadow image 

---->4. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

> $G4WORDIR/bin/Linux-g++/Nanobeam ./macros/file.mac

file.mac can be one of the following macro file :

1) for the computation of intrinsic aberration coefficients :
coef-square.mac : using square magnetic field model
coef-map.mac : using 3D map magnetic field model
coef-enge.mac : using Enge's analytical field model

2) for the simulation of the beam image with a realistic emittance :
image-square.mac : using square magnetic field model
image-map.mac : using 3D map magnetic field model
image-enge.mac : using Enge's analytical field model

3) for the simulatioj of grid shadow images
grid-square.mac : using square magnetic field model
grid-map.mac : using 3D map magnetic field model
grid-enge.mac : using Enge's analytical field model

If file.mac is omitted, the coef-square.mac file is used by default.

---->5. PHYSICS

The example runs with protons with fluctuationg energies around 3 MeV.
Low energy electromagnetic processes are activated by default. 


---->6. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYZIS                                    

The output results consists in several .txt files. 

These files can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the nanobeam directory
* launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
