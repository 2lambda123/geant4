G4VisManager: Using G4TrajectoryDrawByCharge as default trajectory model.
See commands in /vis/modeling/trajectories/ for other options.
Trajectory drawing configuration will be based on imode value of 50
WARNING: G4VisManager::IsValidView(): Attempt to draw when no graphics system
  has been instantiated.  Use "/vis/open" or "/vis/sceneHandler/create".
  Alternatively, to avoid this message, suppress instantiation of vis
  manager (G4VisExecutive), possibly by setting G4VIS_NONE, and ensure
  drawing code is executed only if G4VVisManager::GetConcreteInstance()
  is non-zero.
