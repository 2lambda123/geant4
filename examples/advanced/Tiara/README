Simulation of the TIARA experiment using importance sampling
============================================================

This description assumes the example will be used on a CERN RH 7.3
system. It has been tested with the compiler gcc-3.2. Several 



Building the example
====================

Quick building:
---------------
If the following conditions:
- system = CERN RH 7.3 
- compiler = gcc3.2 
- access to afs exists 
- shell = tcsh
- Geant4 is compiled using G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED 1
are fullfilled the example may be build as follows:

1) setup the environment by typing: source simEnviron.csh 
2) type gmake


In more detail
--------------

Geant4 should be compiled into granular shared libraries.
Therefore before compiling Geant4 set G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED to 1.

External packages used in this example are Anaphe, SWIG and Python.
The Anaphe package comes with SWIG and Python versions used to build
Anaphe itself. These Swig and Python versions should also be used with 
this example.

The file simEnviron.csh provides an example for ho to set the 
environment which works under the above listed conditions. 

Cleaning up
-----------
To remove the directories related to this example under 
$G4WORKDIR/tmp/$G4SYSTEM/ use "gmake tiaraClean".
To remove the files created by swig ( *_wrap.cc, the coresponding 
.py files) use "gmake swigClean.


Runniong the example:
=====================

Change to the sub directory "run" and execute "runSim.py".
"runSim.py" runs an example configuration which nay be
changed by the user. The results of the simulation are stored in 
the directory "simData". 
The script "runSim.py" periodicaly prints scoring information to the 
screeen. 
It also prints out the relative path of a ".shelve" file.
This file can be used to access results of the simulation.

Results may be viewed e.g. using lizard and the script:
1) Start python2.2 or lizard
2) type: import dataAcess
3) type: p = dataAcess.ExpMcPlot (shelveFileName,"00")
         where shelveFileName is the name (enclosed in quotes) of the
         shelve file created during the execution of anaSim.py. 
         The name is printed on the screen during execution of runSim.py.
4) type: p.display ()

Since the simulation time used by "runSim.py" is only 5 minutes the
calculated results have large errors. If you want to see a better result
do the following changes in "naSim.py".
Extend the total run time to 30 minutes by setting:
"totalTime = 30 * myUtils.min", 
set the print out periode to 10 minutes by setting:
"timeForOneRun = 10 * myUtils.min".
