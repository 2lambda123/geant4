Simulation of the TIARA experiment using importance sampling
============================================================

The example has been tested on CERN RH 7.3 with the
gcc-3.2 compiler.

Seting the environment
======================

You should have Geant4 compiled with:
"G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED" set to 1.
You need to set:
"NeutronHPCrossSections" (e.g. to ${G4INSTALL}/data/G4NDL3.7)


Three examples are given of how to set environment variables
in the three cases:

Anaphe via AFS:
---------------
   You have access to afs adn you want to use Anaphe for the
   analysis: 
   Set the follwing environment variables:
   "G4ANALYSIS_USE"

   "ANAPHETOP" (e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx)
   "AIDA_DIR"  (e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/contrib/AIDA/3.0/src/cpp)
   "ANAPHE_SCRIPTS" (e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/5.0.4/scripts)

   Finaly source the script env.Common.csh


No afs but a local Anphe and AIDA installation:
----------------------------------------------
   You don't use afs but you have a local installation of Anaphe and AIDA
   (e.g. from http://anaphe.web.cern.ch/anaphe/.
   Set the follwing environment variables:
   "G4ANALYSIS_USE"
 
   "ANAPHETOP" (e.g. /users/dressel/Anaphe/release)
   "AIDA_DIR"  (e.g. /users/dressel/AIDA/3.0.0/3.0.0/AIDA/3.0/src/cpp)
   "ANAPHE_SCRIPTS" (e.g. ${ANAPHETOP}/share/LHCXX/5.0.5/scripts)

   Finaly source the script env.Common.csh


No afs and no Anaphe and no AIDA (e.g. for system testing):
-----------------------------------------------------------
   You don't want to use Anaphe and AIDA and you don't have no afs access.
   Make sure "G4ANALYSIS_USE" is unset (e.g. unsetenv G4ANALYSIS_USE).

   Set "PYTHONVERSION" (e.g. to  2.2)
   Set "PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR" (e.g. to  /usr/include/python${PYTHONVERSION})
   Set "PYTHON_LIB_DIR" (e.g. to /usr/lib/python${PYTHONVERSION}/config)

   Set "SWIG"  (e.g. to /users/dressel/local/bin/swig)

   Set "CLHEP_BASE_DIR" (e.g. to  /users/dressel/CLHEP)

   Finaly source the script env.Common.csh


Building the example
====================



Quick building:
---------------
Geant4 is compiled using G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED 1 and the one of the above 
environment settings have to be set.

Type "gmake".


In more detail
--------------

Geant4 should be compiled into granular shared libraries.
Therefore before compiling Geant4 set "G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED" to "1".

External packages used in this example are Anaphe, SWIG and Python.
The Anaphe package comes with SWIG and Python versions used to build
Anaphe itself. These SWIG and Python versions should also be used with 
this example. 


Cleaning up
-----------
To remove the directories related to this example under 
$G4WORKDIR/tmp/$G4SYSTEM/ use "gmake tiaraClean".
To remove the files created by swig ( *_wrap.cc, the corresponding 
.py files) use "gmake swigClean.


Running the example:
=====================


Using Anaphe
------------
Change to the sub directory "run" and execute "runSim.py".
"runSim.py" runs an example configuration which nay be
changed by the user. The results of the simulation are stored in 
the directory "simData". 
The script "runSim.py" periodically prints scoring information to the 
screen. 
It also prints out the relative path of a ".shelve" file.
This file can be used to access results of the simulation.

Results may be viewed e.g. using lizard and the script:
1) Start python2.2 or lizard
2) type: import dataAcess
3) type: p = dataAcess.ExpMcPlot (shelveFileName,"00")
         where shelveFileName is the name (enclosed in quotes) of the
         shelve file created during the execution of anaSim.py. 
         The name is printed on the screen during execution of runSim.py.
4) type: p.display ()

Since the simulation time used by "runSim.py" is only 5 minutes the
calculated results have large errors. If you want to see a better result
do the following changes in "naSim.py".
Extend the total run time to 30 minutes by setting:
"totalTime = 30 * myUtils.min", 
set the print out period to 10 minutes by setting:
"timeForOneRun = 10 * myUtils.min".


Not using Anaphe (mainly for system testing)
--------------------------------------------
Change to the sub directory "run" and execute 
runSimNoAnalysis.py.
