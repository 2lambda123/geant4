     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                         Novice Examples
                         ---------------

N01 - Simple example to demonstrate how the GEANT4 basic framework works.
      No physics involved, only tracking on a simple geometry.
N02 - Simulation of a simplified fixed target experiment.
      Includes a simple parameterised geometry. Defines a transverse
      uniform magnetic field. Include standard EM physics for gammas,
      charged leptons and charged hadrons. Includes visualization and
      detector response.
N03 - Simulation of a simple sample Calorimeter setup.
      Shows the usage of 'replicated' volumes in the geometry. Defines
      user commands for primaries generation (isotropic random distribution).
      Defines a transverse uniform magnetic field. Include detector
      response and statistics on relevant quantities. Include a tutorial
      for visualization, exercising different visualization drivers.
