This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

Nov 26, 2004 Marc Verderi (exampleN05-V06-02-01)
- Implemented migration to new G4VParticleChange interfaces.

May 09, 2004 Hisaya Kurashige (exampleN05-V06-02-00)
- Modify method name for ParticleChange in ExN05SpecialCuts.cc

December 09, 2003 Hisaya Kurashige
- Add protection for negative proposed step in ExN05MinEkineCuts.cc

November 10, 2003 Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V05-02-01)
- Removed usage of G4ParticleWithCuts in physics-list (H.Kurasige).
- Removed OPACS driver from vis-manager.
- Cleared usage of LocateGlobalPointAndUpdateTouchable(). Use
  LocateGlobalPointAndUpdateTouchableHandle() instead.
- Cleared compilation warnings.

August 27, 2003 Vladimir Ivanchenko (exampleN05-V05-02-00)
- Migrade to cut per region

May 28, 2003 Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V05-01-00)
- Get rid of pedantic warnings ...

Nov 8, 2001 Radovan Chytracek (exampleN05-V03-02-00)
- RC dev changes propagated to the main trunk HEAD revision

Nov 7, 2001 Marc Verderi (exampleN05-RC-dev)
- changes to be compatible with RC dev: the branch tag is
	dev_rc_touchables_branch_start

Oct 19, 2001  Steve O'Neale (examples-V03-02-00)
- Update reference output

27th April 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V03-01-00)
- Migrated to STL vector. Removed RW wrappers.

25th November 2000 Steve O'Neale (tagset210)
- Update test outputs for min.delta energy cut
- The changes in deposited energy in HAD cal towers upto 20 per cent
- The changes in deposited energy in EM cry(s)tals about 1 part in 10**5

August 03, 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V02-00-01r)
- Changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss in ExN05PionShowerModel.cc to fix problem
  of events' reproducibility.

July 28, 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V02-00-01)
- Includes also new ExN05VisManager class.

June 26, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN05-V02-00-00)
- Reduced no. of events per run from 500 to 250 in exampleN05.large_N.in.

June 24, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN05-V01-01-01)
- Updated exampleN05.out for stand-V01-01-05 and utils-V01-01-03.

June 17, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN05-V01-01-00)
- Updated exampleN05.out for geant4-01-01-ref-06.

23th April 1999 H.Kurashige
- Remove ConstructHad and ConstructLeptHad in ExN05PhysicsList

16th April 1999 H.Kurashige
- modify ExN05RunAction  ExN05SteppingAction ExN05TrackingAction
- modify ExN05PhysicsList::SetCuts

11 December 1998 M. Verderi
- fix made in ExN05CalorimeterSD to allow several instanciations of this class.
  The problem was a static variable (HCID) used in EndOfEventAction which made
  confusion to get the hits collection. HCID is now put as private (non static!) 
  member of the class.
- the example.in/.out are updated accordingly


9 December 1998 M. Verderi
- Added ExN05PionShowerModel: a model producing hits
  for pi+/pi-
- Modify ExN05EMShowerModel to produce a "less unrealistic"
  shower shape: now the longitudinal profile is according to
  the Gamma distribution. Transverse profile is two cylinder:
  the 1 moliere radius receive 90% of the energy, the 3.5 one
  receives the rest.
- Added RandomGamma: shoot at random according to the Gamma
  distribution. Adapted from RNGAMA function of KERNLIB.
  (thanks to D. Bernard who gave me the source).
- ExN05DetectorConstruction. Many changes:
	- EM calo size reduced, crytals also;
	- addition of an hadronic calorimeter
	- addition of a ghost volume
  The G4VFastSimulationModel are instanciated(?) here, and
  no more in exampleN05.cc
- exampleN05.in modified to shoot pions in order to test
  the ghost geometry.
- ExN05PhysicsList modified to add the parameterisation
  process as a Post&Along process, because of the ghost.



16th August 1998 H.Kurashige
- Added ExN05MinRangeCuts, ExN05MinEkineCuts, ExN05MaxTimeCuts
  and their base class of ExN05SpecialCuts for using UserLimits.
- Modified ExN05PhysicsList to register above processes.
- Modified ExN05DetectorConstruction to attach Userlimits to crystal.
- Added ExN05DetectorMessenger to switch on/off UserLimits.
- Modified exampleN05.in 
 

9th August 1998  John Allison
- Changed G4UIterminal to G4UIGAG.

16th July 1998  John Allison
- Changed /vis~/Draw... to /vis~/draw.

June 26th 98 Marc Verderi:

Remove previous files, and add new ones with the
good (hopefully) naming conventions this time.
Improvements done in ExN05EMShowerModel by using
a private navigator, rather than the one for tracking.
