                            ----------


	This example simulates a simple Tracker setup.

 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 	The setup consists of a target and a tracker.  The tracker
     includes several pieces, each of which is a box. 

 	    

 2- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 	The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 	target perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 	and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 	be changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class.

 
 3- DETECTOR RESPONSE
 
 	A HIT is a record, event per event and volume per volume, of all the 
 	informations needed to simulate and analyse the detector response.
 	
 	In this example a TrackerHit is defined as a set of 4 informations per
	layer :
 	- the total energy deposit in the tracker,
 	- the position of the deposit.
